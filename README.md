| [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <fullname>Lambda</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What is Lambda</a> in the <b>Lambda Developer Guide</b>.</p> <p>The <i>Lambda API Reference</i> provides information about each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and response. </p> <p/> <p>You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p> <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/">Lambda endpoints and quotas </a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference.</i>. </p> <p>When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 signing process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference.</i>. </p> <p> <b>CA certificates</b> </p> <p>Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list. </p> </li> </ul> <p>When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Amazon Root CA 1</p> </li> <li> <p>Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2</p> </li> <li> <p>Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority</p> </li> </ul> <p>Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/">Amazon trust services</a>, but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/faqs/#certificates">Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager FAQs.</a> </p> | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [AWSServerlessApplicationRepository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find
 and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
 see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of 
 all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category 
 keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. 
 You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, 
 configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
 within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
 AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
 code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
 For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
 GitHub repository.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
 experiences available:</p><ul>
 <li>

| [Adafruit IO REST API](https://adafruit.com) | ### The Internet of Things for Everyone

The Adafruit IO HTTP API provides access to your Adafruit IO data from any programming language or hardware environment that can speak HTTP. The easiest way to get started is with [an Adafruit IO learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/adafruit-io-basics) and [a simple Internet of Things capable device like the Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).

This API documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages and is available at [https://github.com/adafruit/io-api](https://github.com/adafruit/io-api). For questions or comments visit the [Adafruit IO Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=56) or the [adafruit-io channel on the Adafruit Discord server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).

#### Authentication

Authentication for every API request happens through the `X-AIO-Key` header or query parameter and your IO API key. A simple cURL request to get all available feeds for a user with the username "io_username" and the key "io_key_12345" could look like this:

    $ curl -H "X-AIO-Key: io_key_12345" https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds

Or like this:

    $ curl "https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds?X-AIO-Key=io_key_12345

Using the node.js [request](https://github.com/request/request) library, IO HTTP requests are as easy as:

```js
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  url: 'https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds',
  headers: {
    'X-AIO-Key': 'io_key_12345',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
};

function callback(error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    var feeds = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log(feeds.length + " FEEDS AVAILABLE");

    feeds.forEach(function (feed) {
      console.log(feed.name, feed.key);
    })
  }
}

request(options, callback);
```

Using the ESP8266 Arduino HTTPClient library, an HTTPS GET request would look like this (replacing `---` with your own values in the appropriate locations):

```arduino
/// based on
/// https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266HTTPClient/examples/Authorization/Authorization.ino

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFiMulti.h>
#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>

ESP8266WiFiMulti WiFiMulti;

const char* ssid = "---";
const char* password = "---";

const char* host = "io.adafruit.com";

const char* io_key = "---";
const char* path_with_username = "/api/v2/---/dashboards";

// Use web browser to view and copy
// SHA1 fingerprint of the certificate
const char* fingerprint = "77 00 54 2D DA E7 D8 03 27 31 23 99 EB 27 DB CB A5 4C 57 18";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  for(uint8_t t = 4; t > 0; t--) {
    Serial.printf("[SETUP] WAIT %d...\n", t);
    Serial.flush();
    delay(1000);
  }

  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFiMulti.addAP(ssid, password);

  // wait for WiFi connection
  while(WiFiMulti.run() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.print('.');
    delay(1000);
  }

  Serial.println("[WIFI] connected!");

  HTTPClient http;

  // start request with URL and TLS cert fingerprint for verification
  http.begin("https://" + String(host) + String(path_with_username), fingerprint);

  // IO API authentication
  http.addHeader("X-AIO-Key", io_key);

  // start connection and send HTTP header
  int httpCode = http.GET();

  // httpCode will be negative on error
  if(httpCode > 0) {
    // HTTP header has been send and Server response header has been handled
    Serial.printf("[HTTP] GET response: %d\n", httpCode);

    // HTTP 200 OK
    if(httpCode == HTTP_CODE_OK) {
      String payload = http.getString();
      Serial.println(payload);
    }

    http.end();
  }
}

void loop() {}
```

Implementing a new tool can be daunting, but it doesn't have to. You can implement journy.io in a few different ways to ensure it fits with the rest of your tech stack seamlessly.

We welcome your feedback, ideas and suggestions. We really want to make your life easier, so if we’re falling short or should be doing something different, we want to hear about it. Send us an email at [hi@journy.io](mailto:hi@journy.io) or reach out via the chat on our website or on our platform.

There are multiple ways you can send us data about users and accounts. We have both frontend and backend APIs, which can be used together at the same time.

If you already use [Segment](https://segment.com/), you can [get up and running with journy.io in seconds](https://help.journy.io/en/articles/6488307-the-segment-connector).

# Concepts

## Users

The most basic entity is a user, a specific individual that completed an interaction with your product.

We support multiple types of users, often differentiated by it's external ID prefix. E.g. In the case you are building an ordering app, there could easily be an administrator (who updates products and checks for orders) and the end-customers who place orders. One could have a typical ADM-XXXXXXXX ID, while the other would be referenced by USR-XXXXXXXXX.

## Accounts

In B2B SaaS, users can be part of multiple accounts. E.g. Imagine you're building a content scheduling app where an agency can manage the social media posts of their clients. Each client of the agency has its own account in the product.

If your app doesn't have the concept of a team or group of users, you can ignore accounts.

## Events

An event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and/or an account; and your product. Events can represents any range of interactions. E.g. Every time a customer creates an invoice in an invoicing app. Actions like creating an invoice can be tracked as an event in journy.io.

It's critical to track events properly. You'll need to provide either an account ID, or a user ID, or both; when tracking an event. E.g. If a user updates his personal settings, you can omit the account ID as the event would not be related to any account. In a same logic, an account could get a 'suspend account' event (with account ID) from an internal process, whereas no user would be associated. In most cases, events will be associated to both 1 user and 1 account.

You can optionally pass extra details as metadata (e.g. amount of the invoice). This gets particarly powerfull when creating computed properties on those event metadata. E.g. Our above ordering app could send journy.io 'Place Order' events with metadata 'price', on which journy.io very easily would compute a total order value (for each account) for the last 30 days.

💡 Metadata does not update the properties of a user or account.

# Frontend vs backend

The best implementations we see employ a hybrid approach to maximize data quality while maintaining the flexibility to easily collect the data they need.

We recommend using our JavaScript snippet to track screen views and our backend API to sync users, sync accounts and track events.

When evaluating how to track a particular event, we suggest starting with server-side and only use frontend if it's not possible to collect purely server-side. This can be the case if you need to track interactions with your product that don't result in any natural server requests (such as a button click that opens a modal).

# Frontend

## Setup

💡 You can find the JavaScript snippet in the website settings in the connections view.

Copy the JavaScript snippet and place it in the head or body of your application.

The snippet automatically calls `journy("init", { ... })` and `journy("pageview")`.

## Identify user

💡 A user ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize a user by in your own systems. Because these IDs are consistent across a customer’s lifetime, you should include a user ID in identify calls as often as you can. Ideally, the user ID should be a database ID.

💡 journy.io does not recommend using simple email addresses or usernames as user ID, as these can change over time. journy.io recommends that you use static IDs instead, so the IDs never change. When you use a static ID, you can still recognize the user in your analytics tools, even if the user changes their email address.

💡 The properties `full_name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone` and `registered_at` will be used for creating contacts in destinations like Intercom, HubSpot, Salesforce, ...

`journy("identify")` allows you to identify the user that is currently using your product.

```ts
journy("identify", {
  // Email or user ID is required
  email: "john.doe@acme.com",
  // Unique identifier for the user in your database
  userId: "20",

  // Optional
  // Hash of the user ID using a backend secret
  // You can find the secret in the website settings
  // Recommended to prevent spoofing
  verification: "hash",

  // Optional
  properties: {
    full_name: "John Doe",
    // or
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",

    phone: "123",
    registered_at: new Date(/* ... */),
    is_admin: true,
    key_with_empty_value: "",
    this_property_will_be_deleted: null,
  },
});
```

## Identify account

💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.

💡 The properties `name`, `mrr`, `plan` and `registered_at` will be used to create companies in destinations like Intercom, HubSpot, Salesforce, ...

`journy("account")` allows you to identify the business account (i.e. organization) using your product.

```ts
journy("account", {
  // Required
  // Unique identifier for the account in your database
  accountId: "30",

  // Optional
  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret
  // You can find the secret in the website settings
  // Recommended to prevent spoofing
  verification: "hash",

  // Optional
  properties: {
    name: "ACME, Inc",
    mrr: 399,
    plan: "Pro",
    registered_at: new Date(/* ... */),
    is_paying: true,
    key_with_empty_value: "",
    this_property_will_be_deleted: null,
  },
});
```

## Send page view

💡 In applications, we advise you to use screen views instead of page views.

The JavaScript snippet in the site settings includes a `pageview` by default.

```ts
journy("pageview");
```

If you have a B2B application, we recommend to set account ID for every page view that happens within the context of an account.

💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.

```ts
journy("pageview", {
  accountId: "30",

  // Optional
  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret
  // You can find the secret in the website settings
  // Recommended to prevent spoofing
  verification: "hash",
});
```

## Send screen view

In applications, we strongly advise you to use screen views instead of page views.

Page URLs in applications often include the account ID (e.g. https://app.acme.com/accountId/settings).

This makes it difficult to create signals, segments, ... based on those URLs.

That's what screen views solve. It allows you to set a name for the screen being viewed (e.g. Account settings).

```ts
journy("screen", { name: "Personal settings" });
```

If you have a B2B application, we recommend to set account ID for every screen view that happens within the context of an account.

Example: "Personal settings" would be without account ID, "Team settings" would be with account ID.

💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.

```ts
journy("screen", {
  name: "Account settings",
  accountId: "30",

  // Optional
  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret
  // You can find the secret in the website settings
  // Recommended to prevent spoofing
  verification: "hash",
});
```

## Trigger an event

💡 Use past tense for event names.

User events:

```js
journy("event", {
  // required
  name: "signed_in",

  // optional
  metadata: {
    key: "value",
  },
});
```

Account events:

💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.

```js
journy("event", {
  // required
  name: "created_invoice",
  accountId: "30",

  // Optional
  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret
  // You can find the secret in the website settings
  // Recommended to prevent spoofing
  verification: "hash",

  // optional
  metadata: {
    key: "value",
    amount: 100,
    allow_wire_transfer: true,
  },
});
```

## Identity verification

Identity verification ensures that one person can't impersonate another.

Identity verification requires you to add an hash (HMAC) (that you generate on your server using SHA256) to your installation snippet alongside your user ID and account ID.

journy.io won't accept requests for a logged-in user without a valid hash. The hash is calculated using a secret key, which you should never share. Without this secret key, no third party can send journy.io a valid hash for one of your users, so they can't impersonate your users.

This is optional but highly recommended.

You can enable identify verification in the website settings in the connections view.

```js
journy("identify", {
  userId: "userId",
  verification: "USER_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE"
})

journy("account", {
  accountId: "accountId",
  verification: "ACCOUNT_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE"
})

journy("event", {
  accountId: "accountId",
  verification: "ACCOUNT_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE"
})
```

### PHP

```php
<?php

hash_hmac(
  'sha256', // hash function
  id, // user or account ID
  'secret' // secret key (keep safe!)
);
```

### Node.js

```js
import { createHmac } from "crypto"

createHmac(
  "sha256", // hash function
  'secret' // secret key (keep safe!)
).update(id).digest("hex") // user or account ID
```

### Ruby

```ruby
OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
  'sha256', # hash function
  'secret', # secret key (keep safe!)
  id.to_s # user or account ID
)
```

### Python

```
import hmac
import hashlib

hmac.new(
  b'secret', # secret key (keep safe!)
  bytes(id, encoding='utf-8'), # user or account ID
  digestmod=hashlib.sha256 # hash function
).hexdigest()
```

## Single page application

You can use our JavaScript snippet inside single page applications.

You should call `journy("screen")` (or `journy("pageview")`) whenever a user in your application transitions to another page. You can do this by listening to router change events. The current page URL will always be resolved using `window.location.href`.

You can trigger events using `journy("event")` whenever you need to.

### Next.js

We built a demo app with Next.js. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk-demo-app).

This [component](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk-demo-app/blob/main/components/Journy.js) should be a great start.

You can use the `Script` component from Next.js to load the web snippet and call `init`.

Don't forget to listen on route changes. You can use the `useRouter` hook for that.

### React Router v6

You can use the [`useLocation`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#uselocation) hook to listen for route changes:

```js
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    journy("screen", { name: "name" });
    // or
    journy("pageview");
  }, [location]);

  return (
      // ...
  );
}
```

### Vue Router

You can use [`router.afterEach`](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-after-hooks) to listen for route changes:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({ ... });

router.afterEach((to, from) => {
  journy("screen", { name: "name" });
  // or
  journy("pageview");
});
```

Note: We don't accept a page URL argument for `journy("pageview")`. The current page URL will always be resolved using `window.location.href`.

## TypeScript

We published an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journyio/web-types) with type definitions to enable type-safe usage of our JavaScript snippet. The code and documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/journy-io/web-types).

## Localhost

By default a site doesn't allow page views from other domains than the registered domain. This makes it difficult to test your tracking implementation locally.

You can enable "Allow any domain" in the site settings to disable the domain check.

This will allow you to test the JavaScript snippet with localhost as hostname.

# Backend

The journy.io API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The API is hosted on api.journy.io.

## Official SDKs

Our SDKs are designed to help you interact with our APIs with less friction. They are written in several different languages and help bridge the gap between your application and journy.io APIs. They take away the need to know the exact URL and HTTP method to use for each API call among other things leaving you more time to focus on making your application.

Your favourite programming language not included? [Let us know!](mailto:hi@journy.io)

In the meanwhile, you can use [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to generate a client for your programming language.

## Authentication

The journy.io API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [connections screen](https://system.journy.io).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

For every request send to the API we expect a header `X-Api-Key` to be set with the API Key.

## Permissions

When creating an API Key in [the application](https://system.journy.io) you will have the choice to give permissions to an API Key (which you can change later on). These permissions restrict the API Key from different actions. When an API Key tries to perform a certain action it doesn't have the permissions for, you will receive a `401: Unauthorized` response.

## Rate limiting

To prevent abuse of the API there is a maximum throughput of 1800 requests per minute. If you need a higher throughput, please contact us.

To keep our platform healthy and stable, we'll block API keys that consistently hit our rate limits. Therefore, please consider taking this throughput into account.

In every response the headers `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` will be set. The `X-RateLimit-Limit`-header will always contain the current limit of requests per minute. The `X-RateLimit-Remaining`-header will always contain the amount of requests you have left in the current sliding window.

💡 The client-side tracking uses different rate limits.

## Errors

journy.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with journy.io's servers (these are rare).

When performing a `POST`- or `PUT`-request with a requestBody, or when including parameters, these parameters and fields will automatically be checked and validated against the API Spec. When any error occurs, you will get a response with an `errors`-field, structured as follows:

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "parameters": {
      "header": {
        "headerParameterName": "Describe what's wrong with the header parameter.",
        ...
      },
      "query": {
        "queryParameterName": "Describe what's wrong with the query parameter.",
        ...
      },
      "path": {
        "pathParameterName": "Describe what's wrong with the path parameter.",
        ...
      },
    },
    "fields": {
      "fieldName": "Describe what's wrong with the fieldName.",
      "object.fieldName": "Describe what's wrong with the fieldName of the included object.",
       ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practices

### Track accounts & users immediately on creation

When you create an account in your database, immediately sending data about that account to journy.io helps your team stay in sync. The same goes for users. Call [Upsert account](#operation/upsertAccount) as soon as possible, right after the account is first created in your database.

### Update account data daily

Not every account is active every day. But, you may have properties on the account that change through background processing. That's why we recommend updating every one of your accounts' data in a recurring daily process. This way, you know that your accounts are updated every day in journy.io.

The synchronous version is optimized for frequent and periodic retrievals of small batches of data records (from one record to tens of thousand per query).

Only synchronous version supports retrival of data records by message/record ID.

Vonage recommends that you limit asynchronous queries to a maximum of 20 million records, by setting the start and end dates accordingly. On average, the asynchronous Reports API takes 5 - 10 minutes to generate 1 million records. | `Basic` | Yes | Unknown |

| [Dnd5eapi D&D 5e API](https://github.com/5e-bits) | # Introduction

Welcome to the dnd5eapi, the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition API!
This documentation should help you familiarize yourself with the resources
available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. Read through the getting
started section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved
just by reading through it.

## Getting Started

Let's make our first API request to the D&D 5th Edition API!

Open up a terminal and use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](http://httpie.org/)
to make an API request for a resource. You can also scroll through the
definitions below and send requests directly from the endpoint documentation!

For example, if you paste and run this `curl` command:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ability-scores/cha" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

We should see a result containing details about the Charisma ability score:
```bash
{
  "index": "cha",
  "name": "CHA",
  "full_name": "Charisma",
  "desc": [
    "Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It
      includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent
      a charming or commanding personality.",
    "A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain
      others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie,
      or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,
      Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in
      certain kinds of Charisma checks."
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "Deception",
      "index": "deception",
      "url": "/api/skills/deception"
    },
    {
      "name": "Intimidation",
      "index": "intimidation",
      "url": "/api/skills/intimidation"
    },
    {
      "name": "Performance",
      "index": "performance",
      "url": "/api/skills/performance"
    },
    {
      "name": "Persuasion",
      "index": "persuasion",
      "url": "/api/skills/persuasion"
    }
  ],
  "url": "/api/ability-scores/cha"
}
```

## Authentication

The dnd5eapi is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query
and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just
`GET`-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, feel free to
[message us](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7).

## GraphQL

This API supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). The GraphQL URL for this API
is `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql`. Most of your questions regarding the GraphQL schema can be answered
by querying the endpoint with the Apollo sandbox explorer.

## Schemas

Definitions of all schemas will be accessible in a future update. Two of the most common schemas are described here.

### `APIReference`
Represents a minimal representation of a resource. The detailed representation of the referenced resource can be retrieved by making a request to the referenced `URL`.
```
APIReference {
  index     string
  name      string
  url       string
}
```
<hr>

### `DC`
Represents a difficulty check.
```
DC {
  dc_type       APIReference
  dc_value      number
  success_type  "none" \| "half" \| "other"
}
```
<hr>

### `Damage`
Represents damage.
```
Damage {
  damage_type     APIReference
  damage_dice     string
}
```
<hr>

### `Choice`
Represents a choice made by a player. Commonly seen related to decisions made during character creation or combat (e.g.: the description of the cleric class, under **Proficiencies**, states "Skills: Choose two from	History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and	Religion" [[SRD p15]](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=15))
```
Choice {
  desc      string
  choose    number
  type      string
  from      OptionSet
}
```
<hr>

### `OptionSet`
The OptionSet structure provides the options to be chosen from, or sufficient data to fetch and interpret the options. All OptionSets have an `option_set_type` attribute that indicates the structure of the object that contains the options. The possible values are `options_array`, `equipment_category`, and `reference_list`. Other attributes on the OptionSet depend on the value of this attribute.
- `options_array`
  - `options` (array): An array of Option objects. Each item in the array represents an option that can be chosen.
- `equipment_category`
  - `equipment_category` (APIReference): A reference to an EquipmentCategory. Each item in the EquipmentCategory's `equipment` array represents one option that can be chosen.
- `resource_list`
  - `resource_list_url` (string): A reference (by URL) to a collection in the database. The URL may include query parameters. Each item in the resulting ResourceList's `results` array represents one option that can be chosen.
<hr>

### `Option`
When the options are given in an `options_array`, each item in the array inherits from the Option structure. All Options have an `option_type` attribute that indicates the structure of the option. The value of this attribute indicates how the option should be handled, and each type has different attributes. The possible values and their corresponding attributes are listed below.
- `reference` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to a Document that can be added to the list of options chosen.
  - `item` (APIReference): A reference to the chosen item.
- `action` - A terminal option. Contains information describing an action, for use within Multiattack actions.
  - `action_name` (string): The name of the action, according to its `name` attribute.
  - `count` (number \| string): The number of times this action can be repeated if this option is chosen.
  - `type` (string = `"melee" \| "ranged" \| "ability" \| "magic"`, optional): For attack actions that can be either melee, ranged, abilities, or magic.
- `multiple` - When this option is chosen, all of its child options are chosen, and must be resolved the same way as a normal option.
  - `items` (array): An array of Option objects. All of them must be taken if the option is chosen.
- `choice` - A nested choice. If this option is chosen, the Choice structure contained within must be resolved like a normal Choice structure, and the results are the chosen options.
  - `choice` (Choice): The Choice to resolve.
- `string` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to a string.
  - `string` (string): The string.
- `ideal` - A terminal option. Contains information about an ideal.
  - `desc` (string): A description of the ideal.
  - `alignments` (ApiReference[]): A list of alignments of those who might follow the ideal.
- `counted_reference` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to something else in the API along with a count.
  - `count` (number): Count.
  - `of` (ApiReference): Thing being referenced.
- `score_prerequisite` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to an ability score and a minimum score.
  - `ability_score` (ApiReference): Ability score being referenced.
  - `minimum_score` (number): The minimum score required to satisfy the prerequisite.
- `ability_bonus` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to an ability score and a bonus
  - `ability_score` (ApiReference): Ability score being referenced
  - `bonus` (number): The bonus being applied to the ability score
- `breath` - A terminal option: Contains a reference to information about a breath attack.
  - `name` (string): Name of the breath.
  - `dc` (DC): Difficulty check of the breath attack.
  - `damage` ([Damage]): Damage dealt by the breath attack, if any.
- `damage` - A terminal option. Contains information about damage.
  - `damage_type` (ApiReference): Reference to type of damage.
  - `damage_dice` (string): Damage expressed in dice (e.g. "13d6").
  - `notes` (string): Information regarding the damage.

## FAQ

### What is the SRD?
The SRD, or Systems Reference Document, contains guidelines for publishing content under the OGL. This allows for some of the data for D&D 5e to be open source. The API only covers data that can be found in the SRD. [Here's a link to the full text of the SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)

### What is the OGL?
The Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license by Wizards of the Coast that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works. [More information about the OGL can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License)

### A monster, spell, subclass, etc. is missing from the API / Database. Can I add it?
Please check if the data is within the SRD. If it is, feel free to open an issue or PR to add it yourself. Otherwise, due to legal reasons, we cannot add it.

### Can this API be self hosted?
Yes it can! You can also host the data yourself if you don't want to use the API at all. You can also make changes and add extra data if you like. However, it is up to you to merge in new changes to the data and API.

#### Can I publish is on <insert platform>? Is this free use?
Yes, you can. The API itself is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and the underlying data accessible via the API is supported under the SRD and OGL.

| [Trakt API](https://trakt.tv) | At Trakt, we collect lots of interesting information about what tv shows and movies everyone is watching. Part of the fun with such data is making it available for anyone to mash up and use on their own site or app. The Trakt API was made just for this purpose. It is very easy to use, you basically call a URL and get some JSON back.

More complex API calls (such as adding a movie or show to your collection) involve sending us data. These are still easy to use, you simply POST some JSON data to a specific URL.

Make sure to check out the [**Required Headers**](#introduction/required-headers) and [**Authentication**](#reference/authentication-oauth) sections for more info on what needs to be sent with each API call. Also check out the [**Terminology**](#introduction/terminology) section insight into the features Trakt supports.

# Create an App

To use the Trakt API, you'll need to [**create a new API app**](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new).

# Stay Connected

API discussion and bugs should be posted in the [**GitHub Developer Forum**](https://github.com/trakt/api-help/issues) and *watch* the repository if you'd like to get notifications. Make sure to follow our [**API Blog**](https://apiblog.trakt.tv) and [**@traktapi on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/traktapi) too.

# API URL

The API should always be accessed over SSL.

```
https://api.trakt.tv
```

If you would like to use our sandbox environment to not fill production with test data, use this URL over SSL. **Note:** Staging is a completely separate environment, so you'll need to [**create a new API app on staging**](https://staging.trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new).

```
https://api-staging.trakt.tv
```

# Verbs

The API uses restful verbs.

\| Verb \| Description \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `GET` \| Select one or more items. Success returns `200` status code. \|
\| `POST` \| Create a new item. Success returns `201` status code. \|
\| `PUT` \| Update an item. Success returns `200` status code. \|
\| `DELETE` \| Delete an item. Success returns `200` or `204` status code. \|

# Status Codes

The API will respond with one of the following HTTP status codes.

\| Code \| Description \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `200` \| Success
\| `201` \| Success - *new resource created (POST)*
\| `204` \| Success - *no content to return (DELETE)*
\| `400` \| Bad Request - *request couldn't be parsed*
\| `401` \| Unauthorized - *OAuth must be provided*
\| `403` \| Forbidden - *invalid API key or unapproved app*
\| `404` \| Not Found - *method exists, but no record found*
\| `405` \| Method Not Found - *method doesn't exist*
\| `409` \| Conflict - *resource already created*
\| `412` \| Precondition Failed - *use application/json content type*
\| `420` \| Account Limit Exceeded - *list count, item count, etc*
\| `422` \| Unprocessable Entity - *validation errors*
\| `423` \| Locked User Account - *have the user contact support*
\| `426` \| VIP Only - *user must upgrade to VIP*
\| `429` \| Rate Limit Exceeded
\| `500` \| Server Error - *please open a support ticket*
\| `502` \| Service Unavailable - *server overloaded (try again in 30s)*
\| `503` \| Service Unavailable - *server overloaded (try again in 30s)*
\| `504` \| Service Unavailable - *server overloaded (try again in 30s)*
\| `520` \| Service Unavailable - *Cloudflare error*
\| `521` \| Service Unavailable - *Cloudflare error*
\| `522` \| Service Unavailable - *Cloudflare error*

# Required Headers

You'll need to send some headers when making API calls to identify your application, set the version and set the content type to JSON.

\| Header \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `Content-type` <span style="color:red;">*</a> \| `application/json` \|
\| `trakt-api-key` <span style="color:red;">*</a> \| Your `client_id` listed under your Trakt applications. \|
\| `trakt-api-version` <span style="color:red;">*</a> \| `2` \| API version to use.

All `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods require a valid OAuth `access_token`. Some `GET` calls require OAuth and others will return user specific data if OAuth is sent. Methods that &#128274; **require** or have &#128275; **optional** OAuth will be indicated.

Your OAuth library should take care of sending the auth headers for you, but for reference here's how the Bearer token should be sent.

\| Header \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `Authorization` \| `Bearer [access_token]` \|

# Rate Limiting

All API methods are rate limited. A `429` HTTP status code is returned when the limit has been exceeded. Check the headers for detailed info, then try your API call in `Retry-After` seconds.

\| Header \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `X-Ratelimit` \| `{"name":"UNAUTHED_API_GET_LIMIT","period":300,"limit":1000,"remaining":0,"until":"2020-10-10T00:24:00Z"}` \|
\| `Retry-After` \| `10` \|

Here are the current limits. There are separate limits for authed (user level) and unauthed (application level) calls. We'll continue to adjust these limits to optimize API performance for everyone. The goal is to prevent API abuse and poor coding, but allow users to use apps normally.

\| Name \| Verb \| Methods \| Limit \|
\|---\|---\|---\|---\|
\| `AUTHED_API_POST_LIMIT` \| `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` \| all \| 1 call per second \|
\| `AUTHED_API_GET_LIMIT` \| `GET` \| all \| 1000 calls every 5 minutes \|
\| `UNAUTHED_API_GET_LIMIT` \| `GET` \| all \| 1000 calls every 5 minutes \|

# Locked User Account

A `423` HTTP status code is returned when the OAuth user has a locked user account. Please instruct the user to [**contact Trakt support**](https://support.trakt.tv) so we can fix their account. API access will be suspended for the user until we fix their account.

# VIP Methods

Some API methods are tagged 🔥 **VIP Only**. A `426` HTTP status code is returned when the user isn't a VIP, indicating they need to sign up for [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) in order to use this method. In your app, please open a browser to `X-Upgrade-URL` so the user can sign up for Trakt VIP.

\| Header \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `X-Upgrade-URL` \| `https://trakt.tv/vip` \|

Some API methods are tagged 🔥 **VIP Enhanced**. A `420` HTTP status code is returned when the user has exceeded their account limit. Signing up for [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) will increase these limits. If the user isn't a VIP, please open a browser to `X-Upgrade-URL` so the user can sign up for Trakt VIP. If they are already VIP and still exceeded the limit, please display a message indicating this.

\| Header \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `X-Upgrade-URL` \| `https://trakt.tv/vip` \|
\| `X-VIP-User` \| `true` or `false` \|
\| `X-Account-Limit` \| Limit allowed. \|

# Pagination

Some methods are paginated. Methods with &#128196; **Pagination** will load 1 page of 10 items by default. Methods with &#128196; **Pagination Optional** will load all items by default. In either case, append a query string like `?page={page}&limit={limit}` to the URL to influence the results.

\| Parameter \| Type \| Default \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|---\|---\|
\| `page` \| integer \| `1` \| Number of page of results to be returned. \|
\| `limit` \| integer \| `10` \| Number of results to return per page. \|

All paginated methods will return these HTTP headers.

\| Header \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `X-Pagination-Page` \| Current page. \|
\| `X-Pagination-Limit` \| Items per page. \|
\| `X-Pagination-Page-Count` \| Total number of pages. \|
\| `X-Pagination-Item-Count` \| Total number of items. \|

# Extended Info

By default, all methods will return minimal info for movies, shows, episodes, people, and users. Minimal info is typically all you need to match locally cached items and includes the `title`, `year`, and `ids`. However, you can request different extended levels of information by adding `?extended={level}` to the URL. Send a comma separated string to get multiple types of extended info.

**Note:** This returns a lot of extra data, so please only use extended parameters if you actually need them!

\| Level \| Description \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `full` \| Complete info for an item.
\| `metadata` \| **Collection only.** Additional video and audio info.

# Filters

Some `movies`, `shows`, `calendars`,  and `search` methods support additional filters and will be tagged with &#127898; **Filters**. Applying these filters refines the results and helps your users to more easily discover new items.

Add a query string (i.e. `?years=2016&genres=action`) with any filters you want to use. Some filters allow multiples which can be sent as comma delimited parameters. For example, `?genres=action,adventure` would match the `action` OR `adventure` genre.

**Note:** Make sure to properly URL encode the parameters including spaces and special characters.

#### Common Filters

\| Parameter \| Multiples \| Example \| Value \|
\|---\|---\|---\|---\|
\| `query` \| \| `batman` \| Search titles and descriptions. \|

# CORS

When creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.

# Dates

All dates will be GMT and returned in the ISO 8601 format like `2014-09-01T09:10:11.000Z`. Adjust accordingly in your app for the user's local timezone.

# Emojis

We use short codes for emojis like `:smiley:` and `:raised_hands:` and render them on the Trakt website using [**JoyPixels**](https://www.joypixels.com/) _(verion 6.6.0)_. Methods that support emojis are tagged with &#128513; **Emojis**. For POST methods, you can send standard unicode emojis and we'll automatically convert them to short codes. For GET methods, we'll return the short codes and it's up to your app to convert them back to unicode emojis.

# Standard Media Objects

All methods will accept or return standard media objects for `movie`, `show`, `season`, `episode`, `person`, and `user` items. Here are examples for all minimal objects.

#### movie

# Images

The standard media objects for all `movie`, `show`, `season`, `episode`, and `person` items include an `ids` object. These `ids` map to other services like [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), [TVDB](https://thetvdb.com), [Fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com), and [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

Most of these services have free APIs you can use to grab lots of great looking images. Here’s a chart to help you find the best artwork for your app. [**We also wrote an article to help with this.**](https://apiblog.trakt.tv/how-to-find-the-best-images-516045bcc3b6)

# Website Media Links

There are several ways to construct direct links to media on the Trakt website. The website itself uses slugs so the URLs are more readable.

\| Type \| URL \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `movie` \| `/movies/:slug` \|
\| `show` \| `/shows/:slug` \|
\| `season` \| `/shows/:slug/seasons/:num` \|
\| `episode` \| `/shows/:slug/seasons/:num/episodes/:num` \|
\| `person` \| `/people/:slug` \|
\| `comment` \| `/comments/:id` \|
\| `list` \| `/lists/:id` \|

You can also create links using the Trakt, IMDB, TMDB, or TVDB IDs. We recommend using the Trakt ID if possible since that will always have full coverage. If you use the search url without an `id_type` it will return search results if multiple items are found.

\| Type \| URL \|
\|---\|---\|
\| `trakt` \| `/search/trakt/:id` \|
\|  \| `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=movie` \|
\|  \| `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=show` \|
\|  \| `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=season` \|
\|  \| `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=episode` \|
\|  \| `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=person` \|
\| `imdb` \| `/search/imdb/:id` \|
\| `tmdb` \| `/search/tmdb/:id` \|
\|  \| `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=movie` \|
\|  \| `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=show` \|
\|  \| `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=episode` \|
\|  \| `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=person` \|
\| `tvdb` \| `/search/tvdb/:id` \|
\|  \| `/search/tvdb/:id?id_type=show` \|
\|  \| `/search/tvdb/:id?id_type=episode` \|

### Environment
| API | Description | Auth | HTTPS | CORS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [1ClickImpact](https://docs.1clickimpact.com/) | Environmental impact API for tree planting, carbon offsetting and ocean cleanup | `apiKey` | Yes | Yes |
| [Air Quality Index](https://www.juheapi.com/api-catalog/aqi) | Real-time air quality data including AQI and pollutant concentrations for worldwide locations | No | Yes | Unknown |
| [BreezoMeter Pollen](https://docs.breezometer.com/api-documentation/pollen-api/v2/) | Daily Forecast pollen conditions data for a specific location | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Carbon Interface](https://docs.carboninterface.com/) | API to calculate carbon (C02) emissions estimates for common C02 emitting activities | `apiKey` | Yes | Yes |
| [Climate FieldView Platform APIs](https://climate.com) | **Last Modified**: Wed Jan  4 12:47:29 UTC 2023


All endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS.

* All API endpoints are located at `https://platform.climate.com` (e.g.
`https://platform.climate.com/v4/fields`).

* The authorization token endpoint is located at
`https://api.climate.com/api/oauth/token`.

## Troubleshooting

`X-Http-Request-Id` response header will be returned on every call,
successful or not. If you experience an issue with our api and need
to contact technical support, please supply the value of the `X-Http-Request-Id`
header along with an approximate time of when the request was made.

## Request Limits

When you’re onboarded to Climate’s API platform, your `x-api-key` is assigned a custom usage plan. Usage plans are unique to each partner and have the following key attributes: 

1. Throttling information
    * burstLimit: Maximum rate limit over a period ranging from 1 second to a few seconds
    * rateLimit: A steady-state rate limit

2. Quota information
    * Limit: The maximum number of requests that can be made in a given month

When the request rate threshold is exceeded, a `429` response code is returned. Optionally, the [`Retry-After`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.37) header may be returned: 

Following are examples of rate limit errors:

1. Rate limit exceeded:

<br>HTTP/1.1 429 
<br>Content-Type: application/json
<br>Content-Length: 32

   {"message":"Too Many Requests"}

2. Quota exhausted:
<br>HTTP/1.1 429 
<br>Content-Type: application/json
<br>Content-Length: 29

    {"message":"Limit Exceeded"}

## Pagination

Pagination is performed via headers. Any request which returns a `"results"`
array may be paginated. The following figure shows how query results are laid out with
X-Limit=4 and no filter applied.

<img style="width:70%;height:auto;" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/paging.png">

* If there are no results, a response code of `304` will be returned.

* If the response is the last set of results, a response code of `200` or
`206` will be returned.

* If there are more results, a response code of `206` will be returned.

* If `X-Next-Token` is provided in the request headers but the token has
expired, a response code of `409` will be returned. This is only applicable
for some endpoints; see specific endpoint documentation below.

#### X-Limit

The page size can be controlled with the `X-Limit` header. Valid values are
`1-100` and defaults to `100`.

#### X-Next-Token

If the results are paginated, a response header of `X-Next-Token` will be
returned. Use the associated value in the subsequent request (via the `X-Next-Token`
request header) to retrieve the next page. The following sequence diagram shows how to
use `X-Next-Token` to fetch all the records.

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/x-next-token.svg">


## Chunked Uploads

Uploads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `5MiB` chunks
(with the exception of the final chunk). Each chunk request MUST contain a
`Content-Range` header specifying the portion of the upload, and a `Content-Type`
header specifying binary content type (`application/octet-stream`). Range
uploads must be contiguous. The maximum upload size is capped at `500MiB` (`524288000 bytes`).

## Chunked Downloads

Downloads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `1-5MiB`
chunks (with the exception of the final chunk, which may be less than `1MiB`).
Each chunk request MUST contain a `Range` header specifying the requested portion of the download,
and an `Accept` header specifying binary and json content types  (`application/octet-stream,application/json`)
or all content types (`*/*`).

-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
...
```

Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication, for example:

```
curl
-U "ws@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
...
```

## Versioning
The BinLookup API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v54/get3dsAvailability
```## Going live

To authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.

The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:
```

https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v54/get3dsAvailability
```

Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

## Versioning
Data Protection Service API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DataProtectionService/v1/requestSubjectErasure
``` | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Adyen Management API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/) | Configure and manage your Adyen company and merchant accounts, stores, and payment terminals.
## Authentication
Each request to the Management API must be signed with an API key. [Generate your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) in the Customer Area and then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value.

To access the live endpoints, you need to generate a new API key in your live Customer Area.
## Versioning

Management API handles versioning as part of the endpoint URL. For example, to send a request to version 1 of the `/companies/{companyId}/webhooks` endpoint, use:

```text
https://management-test.adyen.com/v1/companies/{companyId}/webhooks
```

## Going live

To access the live endpoints, you need an API key from your live Customer Area. Use this API key to make requests to:

```text
https://management-live.adyen.com/v1
``` | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Adyen Management Webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/) | Adyen uses webhooks to inform your system about events that happen with your Adyen company and merchant accounts, stores, payment terminals, and payment methods when using [Management API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/latest/overview).

When an event occurs, Adyen makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server and includes the details of the event in the request body.

See [Webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) for more information. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Adyen Payment API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/) | A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.

To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).

## Authentication
You need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) to authenticate to the API.

If using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

 ```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
...
```

Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication, for example:

```
curl
-U "ws@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
...
```

## Versioning
Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v68/authorise
```

## Going live

To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.

| [Adyen Payout API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/) | A set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.

For more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts).
## Authentication
To use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Both of these API credentials must be authenticated with [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).The following example shows how to authenticate your request when submitting a payout:

```
curl
-U "storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
...
```

We also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`

## Headers

Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

\| Name                  \| Type    \| Required \| Description                                                                                                                                                    \|
\| --------------------- \| ------- \| -------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|
\| x-apideck-consumer-id \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. \|
\| x-apideck-service-id  \| String  \| No       \| Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             \|
\| x-apideck-raw         \| Boolean \| No       \| Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      \|
\| x-apideck-app-id      \| String  \| Yes      \| The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             \|
\| Authorization         \| String  \| Yes      \| Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 \|

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

### Query Parameters

\| Name   \| Type   \| Required \| Description                                                                                                        \|
\| ------ \| ------ \| -------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| cursor \| String \| No       \| Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. \|

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

\| Code \| Title                \| Description                                                                                                                                                                                              \|

\| 200  \| OK                   \| The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response. The response message varies, depending on the request method and the requested data.                                \|
\| 201  \| Created              \| The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.                                                                                                              \|
\| 204  \| No Content           \| The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.                                                                          \|
\| 400  \| Bad Request          \| The receiving server cannot understand the request because of malformed syntax. Do not repeat the request without first modifying it; check the request for errors, fix them and then retry the request. \|
\| 401  \| Unauthorized         \| The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.                                                                                              \|
\| 402  \| Payment Required     \| Subscription data is incomplete or out of date. You'll need to provide payment details to continue.                                                                                                      \|
\| 403  \| Forbidden            \| You do not have the appropriate user rights to access the request. Do not repeat the request.                                                                                                            \|
\| 404  \| Not Found            \| The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.                                                                           \|

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

## Support

If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Apideck Customer Support](https://developers.apideck.com) | Welcome to the Customer Support API.

You can use this API to access all Customer Support API endpoints.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`

We also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`

## Headers

Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

\| Name                  \| Type    \| Required \| Description                                                                                                                                                    \|
\| --------------------- \| ------- \| -------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|
\| x-apideck-consumer-id \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. \|
\| x-apideck-service-id  \| String  \| No       \| Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             \|
\| x-apideck-raw         \| Boolean \| No       \| Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      \|
\| x-apideck-app-id      \| String  \| Yes      \| The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             \|
\| Authorization         \| String  \| Yes      \| Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 \|

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

### Query Parameters

\| Name   \| Type   \| Required \| Description                                                                                                        \|
\| ------ \| ------ \| -------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| cursor \| String \| No       \| Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. \|

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

## Support

If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Apideck Ecommerce API](https://developers.apideck.com) | Welcome to the Ecommerce API.

You can use this API to access all Ecommerce API endpoints.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`

We also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`

## Headers

Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

\| Name                  \| Type    \| Required \| Description                                                                                                                                                    \|
\| --------------------- \| ------- \| -------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|
\| x-apideck-consumer-id \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. \|
\| x-apideck-service-id  \| String  \| No       \| Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             \|
\| x-apideck-raw         \| Boolean \| No       \| Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      \|
\| x-apideck-app-id      \| String  \| Yes      \| The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             \|
\| Authorization         \| String  \| Yes      \| Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 \|

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

### Query Parameters

\| Name   \| Type   \| Required \| Description                                                                                                        \|
\| ------ \| ------ \| -------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| cursor \| String \| No       \| Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. \|

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

\| Code \| Title                \| Description                                                                                                                                                                                              \|

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

## Support

If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Apideck Issue Tracking API](https://developers.apideck.com) | Welcome to the Issue Tracking API.

You can use this API to access all Issue Tracking API endpoints.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`

We also provide a [Mock API](https://developers.apideck.com/mock-api) that can be used for testing purposes: `https://mock-api.apideck.com`

## Headers

Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

\| Name                  \| Type    \| Required \| Description                                                                                                                                                    \|
\| --------------------- \| ------- \| -------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|
\| x-apideck-consumer-id \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. \|
\| x-apideck-service-id  \| String  \| No       \| Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             \|
\| x-apideck-raw         \| Boolean \| No       \| Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      \|
\| x-apideck-app-id      \| String  \| Yes      \| The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             \|
\| Authorization         \| String  \| Yes      \| Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 \|

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

### Query Parameters

\| Name   \| Type   \| Required \| Description                                                                                                        \|
\| ------ \| ------ \| -------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| cursor \| String \| No       \| Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. \|
\| limit  \| Number \| No       \| Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    \|

### Response Body

\| Name                  \| Type   \| Description                                                        \|
\| --------------------- \| ------ \| ------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| meta.cursors.previous \| String \| Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API \|
\| meta.cursors.current  \| String \| Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  \|

⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

\| Code \| Title                \| Description                                                                                                                                                                                              \|

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It's most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency's smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

### Query Parameters

\| Name   \| Type   \| Required \| Description                                                                                                        \|
\| ------ \| ------ \| -------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| cursor \| String \| No       \| Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. \|
\| limit  \| Number \| No       \| Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    \|

### Response Body

\| --------------------- \| ------ \| ------------------------------------------------------------------ \|
\| meta.cursors.previous \| String \| Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API \|
\| meta.cursors.current  \| String \| Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  \|
\| meta.cursors.next     \| String \| Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     \|

\| links.next            \| String \| Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       \|

⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

\| Code \| Title                \| Description                                                                                                                                                                                              \|

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

\| Code \| Title                \| Description                                                                                                                                                                                              \|

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

\| x-apideck-downstream-method        \| String \| No       \| Downstream method. If not provided the upstream method will be inherited, depending on the verb/method of the request this will contain the request body you want to POST/PATCH/PUT. \|
\| x-apideck-service-id               \| String \| No       \| Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.                                   \|

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

### apiKey

To use API you have to sign up and get your own API key. Unify API accounts have sandbox mode and live mode API keys. To change modes just use the appropriate key to get a live or test object. You can find your API keys on the unify settings of your Apideck app. Your Apideck application_id can also be found on the same page.

Authenticate your API requests by including your test or live secret API key in the request header.

- Bearer authorization header: Authorization: Bearer <your-apideck-api-key>
- Application id header: x-apideck-app-id: <your-apideck-app-id>
  You should use the public keys on the SDKs and the secret keys to authenticate API requests.

**Do not share or include your secret API keys on client side code.** Your API keys carry significant privileges. Please ensure to keep them 100% secure and be sure to not share your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible like GitHub.

  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)

## Limitations

### Timeout

The request timeout is set at 30 seconds.

### Response Size

The Proxy API has no response size limit. For responses larger than 2MB, the Proxy API will redirect to a temporary URL. In this case the usual Apideck response headers will be returned in the redirect response. Most HTTP clients will handle this redirect automatically.

```
GET /proxy
< 301 Moved Permanently
< x-apideck-request-id: {{requestId}}
< Location: {{temporaryUrl}}

GET {{temporaryUrl}}
< {{responseBody}}
```

\| --------------------- \| ------- \| -------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|
\| x-apideck-consumer-id \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. \|
\| x-apideck-service-id  \| String  \| No       \| Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             \|

## Authorization

You can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Pagination

All API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.

To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.

In the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.

## SDKs and API Clients

We currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.
Need another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).

## Debugging

Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.

## Errors

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

### Handling errors

The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.

### Error Types

#### RequestValidationError

Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.

#### UnsupportedFiltersError

Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.

#### UnsupportedSortFieldError

Sort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.

#### InvalidCursorError

Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.

#### ConnectorExecutionError

A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.

#### UnauthorizedError

We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`

#### ConnectorCredentialsError

A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.

#### ConnectorDisabledError

A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### ConnectorRateLimitError

You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.

#### RequestLimitError

You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.

#### EntityNotFoundError

You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.

#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError

When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.

#### IntegrationNotFoundError

The requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.

#### ConnectionNotFoundError

A valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.

#### ConnectionSettingsError

The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.

#### ConnectorNotFoundError

A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.

#### OAuthRedirectUriError

A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.

#### OAuthInvalidStateError

The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.

#### OAuthCodeExchangeError

When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.

#### OAuthConnectorError

It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### MappingError

There was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError

It seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError

We were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError

Connector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError

The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError

You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.

#### PaginationNotSupportedError

Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.

## API Design

### API Styles and data formats

#### REST API

The API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.

##### Available HTTP methods

The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \_method.

```
POST /messages
GET /messages
GET /messages/{messageId}
PATCH /messages/{messageId}
DELETE /messages/{messageId}
```

Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.

### Schema

All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.

### Meta

Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.

### Idempotence (upcoming)

To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.

Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)

### Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

### Fixed field types

#### Dates

The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).

This example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.

The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.

#### Prices and Currencies

All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.

All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

# <span id="topic-introduction">Introduction</span>

Welcome to bunq!

- The bunq API is organised around REST. JSON will be returned in almost all responses from the API, including errors but excluding binary (image) files.
- Please configure your implementation to send its API requests to `https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/`
- There is a version of the [Android app](https://appstore.bunq.com/api/android/builds/bunq-android-sandbox-master.apk) that connects to the bunq Sandbox environment. To create accounts for the Sandbox app, please follow the steps in the [Android Emulator](#android-emulator) section.

## <span id="topic-introduction-get-started">Getting started</span>

Before you start sending API requests, you need to get an API key and activate it. API activation happens when you install the API key and link your IP address and device to it *(create an API context)*. The steps below will guide you through what you need to do to start sending custom API requests.

Here is an overview of what you can use to get started with the bunq API: 
1. **Create an API key.** You can do it either in our [developer portal](https://developer.bunq.com) or in the bunq app *(Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys)*. If you want to test our sandbox first, our [bunq Developer ](https://developer.bunq.com)is the best place to start.
2. **Register a device.** A device can be a phone (private), computer or a server (public). You can register a new device by using the `POST /installation` and `POST /device-server` calls. This will activate your API key. You only need to do this once.
3. **Open a session.** Sessions are temporary and expire after the auto-logout time set for the user account. It can be changed by the account owner in the bunq app.
4. **Make your first call!**

![bunq_API_context](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/API-context.jpg)

## <span id="topic-introduction-versioning">Versioning</span>

Developments in the financial sector, changing regulatory regimes and new feature requests require us to be flexible. This means we can iterate quickly to improve the API and related tooling. Therefore, we have chosen not to attach any version numbers to the changes just yet. 

We will inform you in a timely manner of any important changes we make before they are deployed on together.bunq.com. You can also [subscribe to our API newsletter](https://bunq.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c00d0d6daea4e1cf7c863d52e&id=b08680cdc7) to make sure you don't miss any important updates. 

# <span id="topic-oauth">OAuth</span>

## <span id="topic-oauth-what-is-oauth">What is OAuth?</span>

[OAuth 2.0](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/getting-ready/) is a protocol that will let your app connect to bunq users in a safe and easy way. Please be aware that if you will gain access to the account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, [you may require a PSD2 permit](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/other/faq#can-we-use-the-bunq-api-to-offer-services-to-third-parties).

## <span id="topic-oauth-get-started-with-oauth-for-bunq">Get started with OAuth for bunq</span>

To initiate authorization into the bunq user accounts, you need to create an OAuth Client and register at least 1 redirect URL for it. 

You can have 1 OAuth Client at a time. Reuse your OAuth credentials for every authorization request. 

The list of steps below will help you to get started:

1. Register an OAuth Client by creating an app in [bunq Developer](https://developer.bunq.com/portal)_._
2. Add one or more Redirect URLs.
3. Get your `client_id` and `secret` from your app information tab in [bunq Developer](https://developer.bunq.com/portal).
4. Redirect your users to the [OAuth authorization request URL](#oauth-authorization-request).
5. If the user accepts the authorization request, they will be redirected to the previously specified `redirect_uri` with an authorization `code` parameter.
6. Use the [token endpoint](#oauth-token-exchange) to exchange the authorization `code` for an `access_token`.
7. Use the `access_token` as a normal API Key. Open a session or use [our SDKs](https://github.com/bunq) to get started.

You can set up an OAuth Client and add redirect URLs to it using the dedicated endpoints too. Follow the flow below to do it programmatically.

ℹ️ As a PSD2 user, you cannot log in to the bunq app. You need to follow the flow below to register an OAuth Client for your application.

![bunq_OAuth_credentials](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/create-oauth-credentials.jpg)

## <span id="topic-oauth-what-can-my-apps-do-with-oauth">What can my apps do with OAuth?</span>

We decided to launch OAuth with a default permission that allows you to perform the following actions:
- read and create Monetary Accounts;
- read Payments & Transactions;
- create Payments between Monetary Accounts of the same user;
- create Draft-Payments (the user will need to approve the payment using the bunq app);
- assign a Monetary account to a Card;
- read, create and manage Cards;
- read and create Request-Inquiries
- read Request-Responses.

As a PSD2-licensed developer, you are limited to the permission scopes of your role.

## <span id="topic-oauth-authorization-request">Authorization request</span>

Your web or mobile app should redirect users to the following URL:

`https://oauth.bunq.com/auth`

The following parameters should be passed:

- `response_type` - bunq supports the authorization code grant, provide `code` as parameter (required)
- `client_id` - your Client ID, get it from the bunq app (required)
- `redirect_uri` - the URL you wish the user to be redirected after the authorization, make sure you register the Redirect URL in the bunq app (required)
- `state` - a unique string to be passed back upon completion (optional)

Use `https://oauth.sandbox.bunq.com/auth` in the sandbox environment.

**Authorization request example:**

```
https://oauth.bunq.com/auth?response_type=code
&client_id=1cc540b6e7a4fa3a862620d0751771500ed453b0bef89cd60e36b7db6260f813
&redirect_uri=https://www.bunq.com
&state=594f5548-6dfb-4b02-8620-08e03a9469e6
```

**Authorization request response:**

```
https://www.bunq.com/?code=7d272be434a75933f40c13d56aef6c31496005b653074f7d6ac57029d9995d30
&state=594f5548-6dfb-4b02-8620-08e03a9469e6

```

![bunq_OAuth_authorization_token_exchange.jpg](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Authorization-token-exchange.jpg)

## <span id="topic-oauth-token-exchange">Token exchange</span>

If the authorization request is accepted by the user, you get the authorization `code`_._ Exchange it for an `access_token`.

Make a `POST` call to `https://api.oauth.bunq.com/v1/token` . Pass the following parameters as `GET` variables:

- `grant_type` - the grant type used, `authorization_code` for now (required)
- `code` -  the authorization code received from bunq (required)
- `redirect_uri` - the same Redirect URL used in the authorisation request (required)
- `client_id` - your Client ID (required)
- `client_secret` - your Client Secret (required)

Use `https://api-oauth.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/token` in the sandbox environment.

**Token request example:**

```
https://api.oauth.bunq.com/v1/token?grant_type=authorization_code
&code=7d272be434a75933f40c13d56aef6c31496005b653074f7d6ac57029d9995d30
&redirect_uri=https://www.bunq.com/
&client_id=1cc540b6e7a4fa3a862620d0751771500ed453b0bef89cd60e36b7db6260f813
&client_secret=184f969765f6f74f53bf563ae3e9f891aec9179157601d25221d57f2f1151fd5
```

Note: The request should only contain URL parameters. No body is expected.

**Example successful response:**

```json
{
    "access_token": "8baec0ac1aafca3345d5b811042feecfe0272514c5d09a69b5fbc84cb1c06029",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "state": "594f5548-6dfb-4b02-8620-08e03a9469e6"
}
```

**Example error response:**

```json
{
    "error": "invalid_grant",
    "error_description": "The authorization code is invalid or expired."
}
```

## <span id="topic-oauth-whats-next">What's next?</span>

To start sending calls to the account of the user who has accepted your authorization request, create an API context for the `access_token` you have received as the result of the token exchange. The `access_token` can be used as a normal API key. Please continue with [Authentication](#authentication).

**NOTE:** When connecting to a bunq user's account using OAuth, you create a new user \(`userApiKey`\) that has its own `id` and `access_token` . When sending a request on behalf of a user connected to your app via OAuth,  use the `id` of `userApiKey`  as `userId` and the item `id`s of the bunq user \(`grantedByUser`\).

**Example of a successful request URL:**

```text
https://api.bunq.com/user/{userApiKey's userId}/monetary-account/{grantedByUser's monetary-accountId}/payment
```

When calling `GET /user/{userID}`, you might expect to get `UserPerson` or `UserCompany`. Instead, you will get the `UserApiKey` object, which contains references to both the user that requested access *(you)* and the user that granted access *(the bunq user account that you connected to)*. 

![bunq_OAuth UserApiKey](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LbhJLuxCAKl5yUuS74T%2F-LuhS4YOAX9bwW1eGYF8%2F-LuhnlwEcVXtLVk6846Z%2FUserApiKey%20creation%20(3).jpg?alt=media&token=d1f212a2-3105-4f0e-a980-34b04a12998a)

Visit us on together.bunq.com, share your creations, ask question and build your very own bunq app!

# <span id="topic-authentication">Authentication</span>

- All requests must use HTTPS. HTTP calls will fail. 
- You should use SSL Certificate Pinning and Hostname Verification to ensure your connection with bunq is secure.
- The auto logout time that you set in the app applies to all your sessions including the API ones. If a request is made 30 minutes before a session expires, the session will automatically be extended.
- We use extra signing on top of HTTPS encryption that you must implement yourself if you are not using the SDKs.

ℹ️ *We use asymmetric cryptography for signing requests and encryption.*
- The client (you) and the server (bunq) must have a pair of keys: a private key and a public key. You need to pre-generate your own pair of 2048-bit RSA keys in the PEM format aligned with the PKCS #8 standard.
- The parties (you and bunq) exchange their public keys in the first step of the API context creation flow. All the following requests must be signed by both your application and the server. Pass your signature in the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header, and the server will return its signature in the `X-Bunq-Server-Signature` header.

## <span id="topic-authentication-device-registration">Device registration</span>

Before you can start calling the bunq API, you must activate your API key, which covers the following steps:
* register your API key, device, and IP address\(es\) _\(only once to activate your API key\);_
* create a session via `POST /session-server`. 

We call this sequence of steps "creating an API context." 

If you are using OAuth to access a user account, you need to create an API context for the `access_token` you receive upon [authorization token exchange](https://doc.bunq.com/#/oauth) too. 

### <span id="topic-authentication-device-registration-using-our-sdks">Using our SDKs</span>

1. Go to our [GitHub](https://github.com/bunq) page.
2. Choose the SDK in your language of choice.
3. Find and use the part dedicated to creating an API context.

1. Create an _Installation_ by calling `POST v1/installation` and passing your pre-generated public key. You will receive an installation _Token._ Use it when making the two following API calls.
2. Create a _DeviceServer_ via `POST v1/device-server`. Provide a description and a secret \(API key in this case\).
3. Create a _SessionServer_ by executing `POST v1/session-server`. You will receive an authentication _Token._ Use it in the API requests in this active session.​

[Import our Postman collection](https://github.com/bunq/postman) to see our pre-setup API context creation calls. It will automatically generate and pre-fill everything in the API calls that create context so you can inspect the process.

### <span id="topic-authentication-device-registration-ip-addresses">IP addresses</span>

When using a standard API Key the DeviceServer and Installation that are created in this process are bound to the IP address they are created from. Afterwards it is only possible to add IP addresses via the Permitted IP endpoint.

Using a Wildcard API Key gives you the freedom to make API calls from any IP address after the POST device-server. You can switch to a Wildcard API Key by tapping on “Allow All IP Addresses” in your API Key menu inside the bunq app. You can also programatically switch to a Wildcard API Key by passing your current ip and a `*` (asterisk) in the `permitted_ips` field of the device-server POST call. E.g: `["1.2.3.4", "*"]`.

# <span id="topic-psd2">Connect as a PSD2 service provider</span>

As a service provider, either an Account Information Service Provider (AISP), Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), or Card Based Payment Instrument Issuer (CBPII), you have obtained or are planning to obtain a license from your local supervisor. You will need your unique eIDAS certificate number to start using the PSD2-compliant bunq API on production.

We accept pseudo certificates in the sandbox environment so you could test the flow. You can generate a test certificate using the command below.

⚠️ Make sure to include AISP and/or PISP in the name to generate a certificate with the roles.

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=My App PISP AISP/C=NL'
```

## <span id="topic-psd2-register-as-a-service-provider">Register as a service provider</span>

Before you can read the information on bunq users or initiate payments, you need to register a PSD2 account and receive credentials that will enable you to access the bunq user accounts.

1. Execute `POST v1/installation` and get your installation *Token* with a unique random key pair.
1. Use the installation *Token* and your unique PSD2 certificate to call `POST v1/payment-service-provider-credential`. This will register your software. 
1. Receive your API key in return. It will identify you as a PSD2 bunq API user. You will use it to start an OAuth flow. The session will last 90 days. After it closes, start a new session using the same API key.
1. Register a device by using `POST v1/device-server` using the API key for the secret and passing the installation *Token* in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. 
1. Create your first session by executing `POST v1/session-server`. Provide the installation *Token* in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. You will receive a session *Token*. Use it in any following request in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header.

**NOTE.** The first session will last 1 hour. Start a new session within 60 minutes.

## <span id="topic-psd2-register-your-applicaton">Register your OAuth application</span>

Before you can start authenticating on behalf of a bunq user, you need to get *Client ID* and *Client Secret*, which will identify you in authorization requests to the user accounts.

1. Call `POST /v1/user/{userID}/oauth-client` to create an OAuth Client.
2. Add a redirect URL to the OAuth Client via `POST /user/{userID}/oauth-client/{oauth-clientID}/callback-url`.
3. Call `GET /v1/user/{userID}/oauth-client/{oauth-clientID}`. We will return your _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_.
4. You are ready to [initiate authorization requests](#oauth-authorization-request).

The flow below will guide you through the full OAuth connection process. Note that you only need to create OAuth credentials once.

![bunq_full_OAuth_flow](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/AuthorizationOAuth-Flow.jpg)

## <span id="topic-psd2-access-user-accounts-as-an-aisp">Access user accounts as an AISP</span>

As an AISP, you are allowed to authenticate in a user’s account and access \(read\) the following account information:

1. legal name
2. IBAN
3. nationality
4. card validity data
5. transaction history
6. account balance

To read the user's information, you need to establish a connection with their bunq account. You can do it using an [authorization request](#oauth-authorization-request). Once a bunq user has confirmed the authorization request and you have done the [token exchange](#oauth-token-exchange), you can activate the Access Token \(use it as an API key\).

Token activation happens when you create an API context \(install it and link your IP adrress and device to it\). See the [OAuth](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/oauth) page for the full flow illustration.

An active Access Token allows you to communicate with the bunq user’s account. You can use it to start a session to interact with the monetary accounts the user allows you to access.

![bunq_AISP](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/AISP.jpg)

## <span id="topic-psd2-initiate-payments-as-a-pisp">Make payments as a PISP</span>

As a PISP, you are allowed to authenticate in a user’s account with the following permissions:
read account information \(via`GET /user`\):
   * legal name;
   * IBAN;
2. initiate payments \(create draft payments via either  `POST /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/draft-payment` or `POST /user/{userID}/payment-service-provider-draft-payment`\) and read their statuses;
3. confirm that the account balance is sufficient for covering the payment \(via`POST /user/{userID}/confirmation-of-funds`\).

The bunq API provides endpoints for different scenarios of the implementation of the payment initiation functionality. In particular, as a PISP user, you can build applications that initiate and authorize one-off or multiple incoming payments. Depending on the use case you are intending to deploy, you might need to initiate the OAuth authorization either before or after the payment initiation.  

### <span id="topic-psd2-initiate-multiple-payments-as-a-pisp">Authorization of multiple (scheduled) payments</span>

It is possible to initiate payments from a bunq user's account having previously established an OAuth connection between your application and the bunq user's account. The bunq user will receive push notifications for each initiated payment.

Once a bunq user has [confirmed they want to make payments via your application](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/psd2/connect-as-a-psd2-service-provider#register-your-application), you can initiate the payment confirmation flow.

1. Create a draft payment via `POST /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/draft-payment`passing the following parameters:
   * `monetary-accountId and userId` (`userApiKey`'s `id`; see [OAuth](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/oauth#user-id-vs-item-ids) for more information) in the endpoint URL;
   * the customer’s email address, phone number, or IBAN in the `counterparty_alias` field of the request body.
2. If the user confirms their intent to make the payment, bunq carries out the transaction.
3. Check the status of the payment via `GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/draft-payment` using the draft payment `id` parameter returned in the previous step. 

![bunq_PISP](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Payment-initiation-1.1-universal.jpg)

### <span id="topic-psd2-initiate-single-payments-as-a-pisp">Single payment authorization</span>

It is possible to initiate payments having only the IBAN of the payer using `POST /user/{userID}/payment-service-provider-draft-payment`.  In this case, the bunq user will accept the payment along with the authorization request. No additional push notifications are sent to the user. 

1. Collect the bunq user's IBAN (and name) in the UI of your application.
2. Create a draft payment via `POST /user/{userID}/payment-service-provider-draft-payment`. 
3. Initiate an [authorization request.](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/basics/oauth#authorization-request) Upon the QR-code scan, the bunq user will see and be able to either accept or reject the payment authorization request.
4. Check the status of the payment.

![bunq_PISP_single_payment](https://www.bunq.com/assets/media/developer/Payment-initiation-1.0.jpg)

## <span id="topic-psd2-confirm-available-funds-as-a-cbpii">Confirm available funds as a CBPII</span>

As a CBPII, you are allowed to authenticate in a user’s account to validate the availability of funds for the payment in question. 

1. Collect an alias for the bunq user's account (their name and IBAN, email address, or phone number).
2. Check the availability of funds via `POST /user/{userID}/confirmation-of-funds` passing the following information:
   * your `userId`;
   * the amount of money needed for the payment;
   * the name of the bunq user and the IBAN of the account (email address or phone number pointing at the user are also possible).

# <span id="topic-signing">Signing</span>
⚠️ **NOTE:**  We deprecated the signing of the entire API request (the URL, headers and body). You only need to sign the request body. Requests with full request signatures are no longer validated.

We are legally required to protect our users and their data from malicious attacks and intrusions. That is why we beyond having a secure https connection, we use [asymmetric cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for signing requests that create a session or payment. The use of signatures ensures the data is coming from the trusted party and was not modified after sending and before receiving.

Request body signing is only mandatory for the following operations: 
- open a session;
- create a payment;
- create a scheduled payment;
- any other operation that executes a payment such as the following:
	- accept a draft payment;
	- accept a scheduled payment;
	- accept a draft scheduled payment;
	- accept a payment request.

You will know that the API call must be encrypted if you get the 466 error code. 

The signing mechanism is implemented in our [SDKs](https://github.com/bunq) so if you are using them you don't have to worry about the details described below.

The signatures are created using the SHA256 cryptographic hash function and included (encoded in base 64) in the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` request header and `X-Bunq-Server-Signature` response header. The data to sign is the following:

- For requests: the body only.
- For responses: the body only.

For signing requests, the client must use the private key corresponding to the public key that was sent to the server in the installation API call. That public key is what the server will use to verify the signature when it receives the request. In that same call the server will respond with a server side public key, which the client must use to verify the server's signatures. The generated RSA key pair must have key lengths of 2048 bits and adhere to the PKCS #8 standard.

## <span id="topic-signing-request-signing-example">Request signing example</span>

Consider the following request, a `POST` to `/v1/user/126/monetary-account/222/payment` (the JSON is formatted with newlines and indentations to make it more readable):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Header</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Cache-Control:</td>
            <td>no-cache</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User-Agent:</td>
            <td>bunq-TestServer/1.00 sandbox/0.17b3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-Bunq-Client-Authentication:</td>

<td>f15f1bbe1feba25efb00802fa127042b54101c8ec0a524c36464f5bb143d3b8b</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

```json
{
	"amount": {
		"value": "12.50",
		"currency": "EUR"
	},
	"counterparty_alias": {
		"type": "EMAIL",
		"value": "bravo@bunq.com"
	},
	"description": "Payment for drinks."
}
```

Let's sign that request. First create a variable `$dataToSign` containing the body of the request:

```json
{
    "amount": {
        "value": "12.50",
        "currency": "EUR"
    },
    "counterparty_alias": {
        "type": "EMAIL",
        "value": "bravo@bunq.com"
    },
    "description": "Payment for drinks."
}
```
Next, create the signature of `$dataToSign` using the SHA256 algorithm and the private key `$privateKey` of the Installation's key pair. In PHP, use the following to create a signature. The signature will be passed by reference into `$signature`.

`openssl_sign($dataToSign, $signature, $privateKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);`

Encode the resulting `$signature` using base64, and add the resulting value to the request under the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header. You have just signed your request, and can send it!

```json
{
	"Response": [

	]
}
```
We need to verify that this response was sent by the bunq server and not from a man-in-the-middle:
- Create a `$dataToSign` variable containing the body of the request.

**NOTE:** We started to only sign the response body on April 28, 2020. Please make sure you validate our new response signature.

So for our example above the response to sign will look like this:

```
{"Response":[{"Id":{"id":1561}}]}
```
Now, verify the signature of `$dataToVerify` using the SHA256 algorithm and the public key `$publicKey` of the server. In PHP, use the following to verify the signature.

`openssl_sign($dataToVerify, $signature, $publicKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);`

## <span id="topic-signing-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</span>

If you get an error telling you "The request signature is invalid", please check the following:

- There are no redundant characters (extra spaces, trailing line breaks, etc.) in the data to sign.
- Make sure the body is appended to the data to sign exactly as you're adding it to the request.
- You have added the full body to the data to sign.
- You use the data to sign to create a SHA256 hash signature.
- You have base64 encoded the SHA256 hash signature before adding it to the request under `X-Bunq-Client-Signature`.

# <span id="topic-headers">Headers</span>

HTTP headers allow your client and bunq to pass on additional information along with the request or response.

While this is already implemented in our [SDKs](https://github.com/bunq), please follow these instructions to make sure you set appropriate headers for calls if using bunq API directly.

## <span id="topic-headers-request-headers">Request headers</span>

### <span id="topic-headers-request-headers-mandatory-request-headers">Mandatory request headers</span>

#### Cache-Control

`Cache-Control: no-cache`

The standard HTTP Cache-Control header is required for all requests.

#### User-Agent

`User-Agent: bunq-TestServer/1.00 sandbox/0.17b3`

The User-Agent header field should contain information about the user agent originating the request. There are no restrictions on the value of this header.

#### X-Bunq-Client-Signature

**⚠️ UPCOMING CHANGE:** Header and URL signature will stop being validated on April 28, 2020. Please [sign the request body](https://doc.bunq.com/#/signing) only.

`X-Bunq-Client-Signature: XLOwEdyjF1d+tT2w7a7Epv4Yj7w74KncvVfq9mDJVvFRlsUaMLR2q4ISgT+5mkwQsSygRRbooxBqydw7IkqpuJay9g8eOngsFyIxSgf2vXGAQatLm47tLoUFGSQsRiYoKiTKkgBwA+/3dIpbDWd+Z7LEYVbHaHRKkEY9TJ22PpDlVgLLVaf2KGRiZ+9/+0OUsiiF1Fkd9aukv0iWT6N2n1P0qxpjW0aw8mC1nBSJuuk5yKtDCyQpqNyDQSOpQ8V56LNWM4Px5l6SQMzT8r6zk5DvrMAB9DlcRdUDcp/U9cg9kACXIgfquef3s7R8uyOWfKLSNBQpdVIpzljwNKI1Q`

The authentication *token* is used to authenticate the source of the API call. It is required by all API calls except for `POST /v1/installation`. 

It is important to note that the device and session calls are using the token from the response of the installation call, while all the other calls use the token from the response of the session-server call:
- Pass the **installation *Token*** you get in the response to the `POST /installation` call in the `/device-server` and `/session-server` calls.
- Pass the **session *Token*** you get in the response to the `POST /session-server` call in all the other calls.

### <span id="topic-headers-request-headers-otpional-request-headers">Optional request headers</span>

#### X-Bunq-Language

`X-Bunq-Language: en_US`

`en_US` is the default language setting for responses and error descriptions.

The X-Bunq-Language header must contain a preferred language indication. The value of this header is formatted as a ISO 639-1 language code plus a ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, separated by an underscore.

Currently only the languages en_US and nl_NL are supported. Anything else will default to en_US.

#### X-Bunq-Region

`X-Bunq-Region: en_US`

`en_US` is the default region for localization formatting.

The X-Bunq-Region header must contain the region (country) of the client device. The value of this header is formatted as a ISO 639-1 language code plus a ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, separated by an underscore.

#### X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id

`X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: a4f0de`

This header has to specify an ID with each request that is unique for the logged in user. There are no restrictions for the format of this ID. However, the server will respond with an error when the same ID is used again on the same DeviceServer.

#### X-Bunq-Geolocation

`X-Bunq-Geolocation: 4.89 53.2 12 100 NL`

`X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000` *(if no geolocation is available or known)*

This header has to specify the geolocation of the device. It makes it possible for bunq to map the geolocation with the payment.
‌
The format of this value is longitude latitude altitude radius country. The country is expected to be formatted of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. When no geolocation is available or known the header must still be included but can be zero valued.

### <span id="topic-headers-request-headers-attachment-headers">Attachment headers</span>

#### Content-Type

# <span id="topic-errors">Errors</span>

Familiar HTTP response codes are used to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

Generally speaking, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, while codes in the 4xx range indicate an error having to do with provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, insufficient funds, etc.).

Finally, codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with bunq servers. If this is the case, please stop by the support chat and report it to us.

All errors 4xx code errors will include a JSON body explaining what went wrong.

## <span id="topic-errors-rate-limits">Rate limits</span>

If you are receiving the error 429, please make sure you are sending requests at rates that are below our rate limits.

Our rate limits per IP address per endpoint:

- GET requests: 3 within any 3 consecutive seconds
- POST requests: 5 within any 3 consecutive seconds
- PUT requests: 2 within any 3 consecutive seconds
- Callbacks: 2 callback URLs per notification category

We have a lower rate limit for `/session-server`: 1 request within 30 consecutive seconds.

# <span id="topic-api-conventions">API conventions</span>

Make sure to follow these indications when using the bunq API or get started with our SDKs.

## <span id="topic-api-conventions-responses">Responses</span>

All JSON responses have one top level object. In this object will be a Response field of which the value is always an array, even for responses that only contain one object.

Example response body

```json
{
	"Response": [
		{
			"DataObject": {}
		}
	]
}
```

## <span id="topic-api-conventions-errors">Errors</span>

- Error responses also have one top level Error object.
- The contents of the array will be a JSON object with an error_description and error_description_translated field.
- The error_description is an English text indicating the error and the error_description_translated field can be shown to end users and is translated into the language from the X-Bunq-Language header, defaulting to en_US.
- When using bunq SDKs, error responses will be always raised in form of an exception.

Example response body
```json
{
	"Error": [
		{
			"error_description": "Error description",
			"error_description_translated": "User facing error description"
		}
	]
}
```

## <span id="topic-api-conventionsobject-type-indications">Object Type indications</span>

When the API returns different types of objects for the same field, they will be nested in another JSON object that includes a specific field for each one of them. Within bunq SDKs a BunqResponse object will be returned as the top level object.

In this example there is a field content, which can have multiple types of objects as value such as — in this case — ChatMessageContentText. Be sure to follow this convention or use bunq SDKs instead.

```json
{
	"content": {
		"ChatMessageContentText": {
			"text": "Hi! This is an automated security message. We saw you just logged in on an My Device Description. If you believe someone else logged in with your account, please get in touch with Support."
		}
	}
}
```

## <span id="topic-api-conventions-time-formats">Time formats</span>

Times and dates being sent to and from the API are in UTC. The format that should be used is `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ssssss`, where the letters have the meaning as specified in ISO 8601. For example: `2017-01-13 13:19:16.215235`.

# <span id="topic-callbacks">Callbacks</span>

Callbacks are used to send information about events on your bunq account to a URL of your choice, so that you can receive real-time updates.

## <span id="topic-callbacks-notification-filters">Notification Filters</span>

To receive notifications for certain activities on a bunq account, you have to create notification filters. It is possible to send the notifications to a provided URL and/or the user’s phone as push notifications.

Use the `notification-filter-push` resource to create and manage push notification filters. Provide the type of events you want to receive notifications about in the `category` field. 

```json    
{
   "notification_filters":[
      {
         "category":"SCHEDULE_RESULT"
      }
   ]
}
```

Use the `notification-filter-url` resource to create and manage URL notification filters. The callback URL you provide in the `notification_target` field must use HTTPS. 

```json
{
   "notification_filters":[
      {
         "category":"PAYMENT",
         "notification_target":"{YOUR_CALLBACK_URL}"
      }
   ]
}
```

### <span id="topic-callbacks-notification-filters-mutation-category">Mutation category</span>

A Mutation is a change in the balance of a monetary account. So, for each payment-like object, such as a request, iDEAL-payment or a regular payment, a Mutation is created. Therefore, the `MUTATION` category can be used to keep track of a monetary account's balance.

### <span id="topic-callbacks-notification-filters-receiving-callbacks">Receiving callbacks</span>

Callbacks for the sandbox environment will be made from different IP's at AWS.  
Callbacks for the production environment will be made from `185.40.108.0/22`.

*The IP addresses might change*. We will notify you in a timely fashion if such a change would take place.

### <span id="topic-callbacks-notification-filters-retry-mechanism">Retry mechanism</span>

When the execution of a callback fails (e.g. if the callback server is down or the response contains an error) it is tried again for a maximum of 5 times, with an interval of one minute between each try. If your server is not reachable by the callback after the 6th total try, the callback is not sent anymore.

### <span id="topic-callbacks-notification-filters-removing-callbacks">Removing callbacks</span>

To remove callbacks for an object, send a PUT request to the *user-person*, *user-company*, *monetary-account* or *cash-register* resource with the `notification_filters` field of the JSON request body unset.
```
{
    "notification_filters": []
}
```

## <span id="topic-callbacks-certificate-pinning">Certificate pinning</span>

We recommend you use certificate pinning as an extra security measure. With certificate pinning, we check the certificate of the server on which you want to receive callbacks against the pinned certificate that has been provided by you and cancel the callback if that check fails.

### <span id="topic-callbacks-certificate-pinning-how-to-set-up-certificate-pinning">How to set up certificate pinning</span>

Retrieve the SSL certificate of your server using the following command:

1. `openssl s_client -servername www.example.com -connect www.example.com:443 < /dev/null \| sed -n "/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p" > www.example.com.pem`
2. `POST` the certificate to the certificate-pinned endpoint.

Now every callback that is made will be checked against the pinned certificate that you provided. Note that if the SSL certificate on your server expires or is changed, our callbacks will fail.

# <span id="topic-pagination">Pagination</span>

In order to control the size of the response of a `LIST` request, items can be paginated. A `LIST` request is a request for every one of a certain resources, for instance all payments of a certain monetary account `GET /v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment`). You can decide on the maximum amount of items of a response by adding a `count` query parameter with the number of items you want per page to the URL. For instance:

`GET /v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment?count=25`

When no `count` is given, the default count is set to 10. The maximum `count` you can set is 200.

With every listing, a `Pagination` object will be added to the response, containing the URLs to be used to get the next or previous set of items. The URLs in the Pagination object can be used to navigate through the listed resources. The Pagination object looks like this given a count of 25:

```json
{
    "Pagination": {
        "future_url": null,
        "newer_url": "/v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment?count=25&newer_id=249",
        "older_url": "/v1/user/1/monetary-account/1/payment?count=25&older_id=224"
    }
}
```

The `newer_url` value can be used to get the next page. The `newer_id` is always the ID of the last item in the current page. If `newer_url` is `null`, there are no more recent items before the current page.

The `older_url` value can be used to get the previous page. The `older_id` is always the ID of the first item in the current page. If `older_url` is `null`, there are no older items after the current page.

The `future_url` can be used to refresh and check for newer items that didn't exist when the listing was requested. The `newer_id` will always be the ID of the last item in the current page. `future_url` will be `null` if `newer_id` is not also the ID of the latest item.

# <span id="topic-sandbox">Sandbox</span>
*The sandbox base URL is https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/*

We do not use real money and do not allow external transactions in the sandbox environment. 

## Sandbox user accounts
You need to create a sandbox user to test the bunq API. The easiest way to do it is by using [our developer portal](https://developer.bunq.com/):
1. Log in using your bunq account or [create a free developer account](https://developer.bunq.com/portal/signup) with sandbox-only access.
1. Go to Sandbox Users.
1. Generate up to 5 users.
1. Use the sandbox API key to create an API context and/or use the user credentials to log in to the [sandbox bunq app](https://doc.bunq.com/#/android-emulator).

### Alternative ways to generate sandbox API keys
There are 3 other ways you can generate a bunq sandbox API key:
* connect to [Tinker](https://lexy.gitbook.io/bunq/quickstart/tinker) *(it will also return login credentials for the sandbox app)*;
* create it in the [sandbox app](https://doc.bunq.com/#/android-emulator) *(you need to be logged in as a sandbox user)*;
* call the sandbox user endpoints directly, using [our Postman collection](https://github.com/bunq/postman), or by running a cURL command (change `sandbox-user-person` to `sandbox-user-company` to generate a business user):

```
curl https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/sandbox-user-person -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Cache-Control: none" --header "User-Agent: curl-request" --header "X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: $(date)randomId" --header "X-Bunq-Language: nl_NL" --header "X-Bunq-Region: nl_NL" --header "X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000"
```

⚠️ **NOTE:** An API key can only be assigned to an IP within 1 hour after its creation. After the 1 hour, it will become invalid if not assigned. API keys that are created via the sandbox app are wiped with each sandbox reset.

Once you have a sandbox API key, create more sandbox users to use as test customer accounts, and start playing with the API. 

The sandbox base URL is https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/.

## Sandbox money
Without money, it's not always sunny in the sandbox world. Fortunately, getting money on the bunq sandbox is easy. All you need to do is ask Sugar Daddy for it.

Send a `POST v1/request-inquiry` request passing sugardaddy@bunq.com  in the counterparty_alias field. Specify the type for the alias and set the `allow_bunqme` field. Request up to €500 at a time.
```
{
    "amount_inquired": {
        "value": "100",
        "currency": "EUR"
    },
    "counterparty_alias": {
        "type": "EMAIL",
        "value": "sugardaddy@bunq.com",
        "name": "Sugar Daddy"
    },
    "description": "You're the best!",
    "allow_bunqme": false
}
```

# <span id="topic-android-emulator">Android Emulator</span>

In case you do not own an Android device on which you can run our Sandbox app for end-to-end testing, you can set up an emulator to run the bunq Sandbox app for Android.

## Things you will need

- The [bunq Sandbox App APK](https://appstore.bunq.com/api/android/builds/bunq-android-sandbox-master.apk) that's optimised for emulating;
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

## Starting the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager

1. Open Android Studio.
2. From the top menu, select “Tools” > "Android" > "AVD Manager".

## Setting up a new virtual device

1. Start the wizard by clicking on "+ Create Virtual Device".
2. Select a device (recommendation: "Pixel 5.0" or "Nexus 6") and press "Next".
3. Select an x86 system image (recommendation: Nougat, API Level 25, Android 7.1.1 with Google APIs) and press "Next". The image needs to have Google Play Services 10.0.1 or higher.
4. In the bottom left corner, select "Show Advanced Settings".
5. Scroll to "Memory and Storage".
6. Change "Internal Storage" to "2048 MB".
7. Change "SD card" to "200 MB".
8. Press "Finish".

## Starting the virtual device

1. On the right side under "Actions", select the green "Play" button.
2. Wait for the device to boot, this may take a few minutes.

## Installing the bunq Sandbox App APK

1. Open the command line.
2. Navigate to your Android SDK platform tools directory (e.g. `cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools` on macOS).
3. Make sure that the virtual device is started and has fully booted.
4. Run `./adb install ~/Downloads/bunq-android-sandboxEmulator-public-api.apk`, this may take a few minutes, and should finish with "Success".

## Creating an account or logging in

1. Create a sandbox account in the [developer portal](https://developer.bunq.com/).
1. Log in to the sandbox app using the sandbox user credentials.

ℹ️ *You will be asked to verify your phone number when you open the app for the first time. Sandbox does not send actual SMS messages. Enter any valid phone number and use the default verification code `992266`*. 

If you couldn't generate a sandbox account in the developer portal, use Tinker:
1. Install [Tinker](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/quickstart/tinker).
1. Run `tinker/user-overview` to create a sandbox account. The output of the command will include the login credentials for the sandbox account.

⚠️ **NOTE:** It is **not** possible to create accounts using the regular signup in the app, bunq is not reviewing Sandbox applications.

# <span id="topic-moving-to-production">Moving to Production</span>

Have you tested your bunq integration to the fullest and are you now ready to introduce it to the world? Then the time has come to move it to a production environment!

To get started you'll need some fresh API keys for the production environment, which you can create via your bunq app. You can create these under "Profile" by tapping the "Security" menu. We do, however, highly recommend using a standard API Key instead of a Wildcard API Key. The former is significantly safer and it protects you from intrusions and possible attacks.

There's only a few things to do before your beautiful bunq creation can be moved to production. You're going to have to change your API Key and redo the sequence of calls to open a session.

The bunq Public API production environment is hosted at `https://api.bunq.com`.

Do you have any questions or remarks about the process, or do you simply want to show off with your awesome creations? Don't hesitate to drop us a line on [together.bunq.com](https://together.bunq.com).

Please be aware that if you will gain access to account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you  maybrequire a PSD2 permit.

# <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session">Quickstart: Opening a Session</span>

## <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-goal">Goal</span>

So, you want to start using the bunq API, awesome! To do this, you have to open a session in which you will be making those calls.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-getting-an-api-key">Getting an API key</span>

To connect to the API, you have to make sure you have received an API key. 

**For production:**
1. create an app in the [developer portal](http://developer.bunq.com/), or
1. generate it in the bunq app *(Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys)*.

**For sandbox**
You can use one of the following ways:
- create a sandbox user in the [developer portal](http://developer.bunq.com/);
- generate an API key in the [sandbox app](#android-emulator) *(Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys)*;
- get an API key from [Tinker](https://beta.doc.bunq.com/quickstart/tinker);
- run a cURL request: `curl https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/sandbox-user-person -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Cache-Control: none" --header "User-Agent: curl-request" --header "X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: $(date)randomId" --header "X-Bunq-Language: nl_NL" --header "X-Bunq-Region: nl_NL" --header "X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000"`. Use `sandbox-user-company` to generate a business user.

Note that production API key is only usable on production and sandbox key is only usable on sandbox. Sandbox key has a `sandbox_` prefix while production key does not have any noticeable prefixes.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence">Call sequence</span>

The calls you need to perform to set up a session from scratch are the following:

### <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence-post-installation">1. POST installation</span>

Each call needs to be signed with your own private key. An Installation is used to tell the server about the public key of your key pair. The server uses this key to verify your subsequent calls.

Start by generating a 2048-bit RSA key pair. You can find examples by looking at the source code of the sdk's located at github.

#### Headers

On the headers page you can find out about the mandatory headers. Take care that if you are in the sandbox environment, you set an `Authorization` header. Specific to the `POST /installation` call, you shouldn't use the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` or the `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` headers.

#### Body

Post your public key to the Installation endpoint (use `\n` for newlines in your public key).

#### Response

Save the Installation token and the bunq API's public key from the response. This token is used in the `Authentication` header to register a `DeviceServer` and to start a `SessionServer`. The bunq API's public key should be used to verify future responses received from the bunq API.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence-post-device-server">2. POST device-server</span>

Further calls made to the server need to come from a registered device. `POST /device-server` registers your current device and the IP address(es) it uses to connect to the bunq API.

#### Headers

Use the token you received from `POST /installation` in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. Make sure you sign your call, passing the call signature in `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header.

#### Body

For the secret, use the API key you received. If you want to create another API key, you can do so in the bunq sandbox app (or production app for the production environment). Login, go to Profile > Security and tap 'API keys'. The freshly created API key can be assigned to one or multiple IP addresses using `POST device-server` within 4 hours before becoming invalid. As soon as you start using your API key, it will remain valid until the next sandbox reset.   For the secret, use the API key you received.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-opening-a-session-call-sequence-post-session-server">3. POST session-server</span>

To make any calls besides `installation` and `device-server`, you need to open a session.

#### Headers

Use the token you received from `POST /installation` in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header. Make sure you sign your call, passing the call signature in `X-Bunq-Client-Signature` header.

#### Body

For the secret, use the API key you received.

#### Response

The token received in the response to `POST /session-server` should be used to authenticate your calls in this session. Pass this session's token in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header on every call you make in this session.

# <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request">Quickstart: Payment Request</span>

## <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-goal">Goal</span>

You want to offer bunq payments on a website or in an application.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-scenario">Scenario</span>

In this use case the consumer and the merchant both have a bunq account. The consumer wants to pay with bunq and enters their alias in the bunq payment field at checkout. The merchant sends the request for payment to the consumer when the consumer presses enter. The consumer agrees to the request in the bunq mobile app and the merchant has immediate confirmation of the payment. Please be aware that if you will gain access to account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you require a PSD2 permit.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-before-you-start">Before you start</span>

Make sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence">Call Sequence</span>

The consumer is at checkout and selects the bunq payment method. This would be a logical time to open a session on the bunq server.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-list-monetary-account">1. LIST monetary-account</span>

When a request for payment is accepted, the money will be deposited on the bank account the request for payment is connected to. Let’s start by finding all your available bank accounts. Pick one of them to make the request for payment with and save its `id`.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-post-monetary-account-attachment">2. POST monetary-account attachment (optional)</span>

Optionally, you can attach an image to the request for payment.

#### Headers
Make sure you set the `Content-Type` header to match the MIME type of the image. It’s also required you pass a description of the image via the `X-Bunq-Attachment-Description` header.

#### Body
The payload of this request is the binary representation of the image file. Do not use any JSON formatting.

#### Response
Save the `id` of the posted attachment. You’ll need it to attach it to the request for payment.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-post-request-inquiry">3. POST request-inquiry</span>

Next, create a request inquiry. A request inquiry is the request for payment that your customer can respond to by accepting or rejecting it.

#### Body

Pass the customer’s email address, phone number or IBAN in the `counterparty_alias`. Make sure you set the correct `type` for the alias, depending on what you pass. When providing an IBAN, a name of the `counterparty_alias` is required. You can provide the `id` of the created attachment.

#### Response

You will receive the `id` of the created request inquiry in the response. Save this `id`. You will need it to check if the customer has responded to the request yet.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-payment-request-call-sequence-get-request-inquiry">4. GET request-inquiry</span>

After you’ve sent the request for payment, its status can be checked.

#### Response

When the `status` is `ACCEPTED`, the customer has accepted and paid the request, and you will have received the money on the connected monetary account. If the `status` is `REJECTED`, the customer did not accept the request.

# <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment">Quickstart: Create a Tab payment</span>

## <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-goal">Goal</span>

You will create a tab that can be paid once by a single user, a so called TagUsageSingle, and explore three different ways to make the Tab visible to your customers:

- QR code from the CashRegister
- QR code from the Tab.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-before-you-start">Before you start</span>

Make sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header.

## <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence">Call sequence</span>

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-attachment-public">1. POST attachment-public</span>

Start by creating an attachment that will be used for the avatar for the cash register.

#### Header

Make sure you set the `Content-Type` header to match the MIME type of the image. It is also required you pass a description of the image via the `X-Bunq-Attachment-Description` header.

#### Body

The payload of this request is the binary representation of the image file. Do not use any JSON formatting.

#### Response

Save the `uuid` of the posted attachment. You'll need it to create the avatar in the next step.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-avatar">2. POST avatar</span>

Make an avatar using the public attachment you've just created.

#### Body

The payload of this request is the `uuid` of the attachment public.

#### Response

In response, you’ll receive the UUID of the avatar created using the attachment. Save this UUID. You’ll use it as the avatar for the cash register you're about to create.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-list-monetary-account">3. LIST monetary-account</span>

Get a listing of all available monetary accounts. Choose one, and save the id of the monetary account you want your cash register to be connected to. Each paid tab for the cash register will transfer the money to this account.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-cash-register">4a. POST cash-register</span>

Create a cash register. Use the `id` of the monetary account you want to connect the cash register to in the URL of the request.

#### Body

In the body provide the `uuid` of the avatar you created for this cash register. Also make sure to provide a unique name for your cash register. Set the status to `PENDING_APPROVAL`.

#### Response

The response contains the `id` of the cash register you created. Save this `id`. You will need it to create subsequent tabs and tab items.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-wait-for-approval">4b. Wait for approval</span>

On the production environment, a bunq admin will review and approve your cash register. In the sandbox environment, your cash register will be automatically approved.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-tab-usage-single">5. POST tab-usage-single</span>

Create a new tab that is connected to your cash register. Use the id of the cash register you want to connect this tab to in the URL of your request.

#### Body

Give the tab a name in `merchant_reference`. Create the tab with status `OPEN`, and give the tab a starting amount. You can update this amount later.

#### Response

The response contains the uuid of the tab you created.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-post-tab-item">6. POST tab-item (optional)</span>

You can add items to a tab. For instance, if a customer will be paying for multiple products via this tab, you can decide to add an item for each of these. Adding items to a tab is optional, and adding them will not change the total amount of the tab itself. However, if you've added any tab items the sum of the amounts of these items must be equal to the `total_amount` of the tab when you change its status to `WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT`.

### <span id="topic-quickstart-create-a-tab-payment-call-sequence-put-tab-usage-single">7. PUT tab-usage-single</span>

Update the status of the tab to `WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT` if you want the costumer to pay the tab, and you're done adding any tab items. You can use this request to make the tab visible for your costumers.

#### Visibility

To decide how you are going to make your tab visible, pass a visibility object in the payload.

Setting `cash_register_qr_code` to true will connect this tab to the QR code from the cash register. If this cash register does not have a QR code yet, one will be created. Only one Tab can be connected to the cash register’s QR code at any given time.

Setting `tab_qr_code` to true will create a QR code specifically for this tab. This QR code can not be linked to anything else.

# <span id="topic-quickstart-transwerwise-payment">Quickstart: Create a TransferWise payment</span>

## Goal

You want to send a payment in currency other than euro outside the SEPA zone.

## Before you start

Make sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the `X-Bunq-Client-Authentication` header.

ℹ️ *bunq relies on TransferWise for international, so you need to create a TransferWise account linked to a bunq account to be able to create international transfers. You can do it either from the bunq app or using our API as described below.*

## Get the up-to-date exchange rate (optional)

You might want to check the latest currency exchange rate before making a transfer. Here’s how you can do it using the bunq API:
1. Check the list of supported currencies via `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-currency`. Copy the needed currency code.
2. Create a temporary quote for the currency of your choice via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote-temporary`.

ℹ️ *A quote is the exchange rate at the exact timestamp. Temporary quotes carry solely informative value and cannot be used for creating a transfer.*

3. Read the temporary quote via `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote-temporary/{transferwise-quote-temporaryID}`.

## Create a TransferWise account

You need a TransferWise account linked to your bunq account to make TransferWise payments via the bunq API. Create one via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-user`, and save its ID. 

ℹ️ *You cannot use an existing TransferWise account.*

## Create a quote

1. Create a quote via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote and save its ID. 

ℹ️ *Use amount_target to indicate the sum the recipient must get. Amount_source, on the other hand, will indicate the sum you want to send, but it will not necessarily be the final sum the recipient gets.*

ℹ️ *Quotes are valid for 30 minutes so if you do not manage to create a transfer within this time, you will need to create another quote.*

2. Get the exchange rate by reading the quote via GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/(transferwise-quoteID).

## Create a recipient

If you have sent money via the TransferWise account linked to your bunq account, you can reuse the recipients. You can list their IDs via `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient`.

To create a new, previously unused recipient, follow these steps:
1. Retrieve the fields required for creating the recipient as the requirements vary for the type of recipient in each country. Iterate sending the following request pair till there are no more required fields:
- `GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement`
- `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement`
2. Create a recipient account using the final request body from the previous step with `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement`

## Create a transfer

Finally, having both the quote ID and the recipient ID, you can create a transfer. 🎉

1. Check if there are any additional transfer requirements via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-transfer-requirement`.
2. Create a transfer via `POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-transfer`. You need to specify the ID of the monetary account from which you want the payment to be made.

# <span id="topic-quickstart-attachments">Quickstart: Downloading attachments</span>

## Goal
Export receipts and invoices attached to payments to your application.

## The scenario you want to achieve
0. The bunq user has accepted the authorization request and your application can read the bunq user’s account information.
1. Your application imports all the transactions and attachments.
2. The bunq user sees the transactions matched with the receipts and invoices in your application.

## Before you start
* Make sure that you have opened a session
* Make sure you pass the session Token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header in all the following requests of the session.

## Call sequence
1. List the payments of the user via GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/payment.
2. Check if the payments have attachments via GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/payment/{paymentID}/note-attachment. Save the attachment IDs.
3. Export the raw content of the attachments via GET /user/{userID}/attachment/{attachmentID}/content.

# Authorization

## Initial authorization

There are three main steps in the OAuth 2.0 authentication workflow:

1. Redirect the provider to the authorization page.
2. The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to
   your web application.
3. Your application exchanges the `authorization_code` that came with
   the redirect for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

### Step 1: Redirect to drchrono

The first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button
labeled "Connect to drchrono" or "Login with drchrono".  This is just a link that
takes your user to the following URL:

    https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED&response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID_ENCODED&scope=SCOPES_ENCODED

- `REDIRECT_URI_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).
- `CLIENT_ID_ENCODED` is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.
- `SCOPES_ENCODED` is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.

The `scope` parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.
If omitted, all scopes will be requested.

Scopes are of the form `BASE_SCOPE:[read\|write]` where `BASE_SCOPE` is any of `user`, `calendar`, `patients`, `patients:summary`, `billing`, `clinical` and `labs`.
You should request only the scopes you need.
For instance, an application which sends "Happy Birthday!" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter `"patients:summary:read"`,
while one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least
`"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write"`.

### Step 2: Provider authorization

After logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen
with your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the
`scope` parameter).

When they click the "Authorize" button, they will be redirected to your redirect
URI with a `code` query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be
used in step 3.  If they click the "Cancel" button, they will be redirected to
your redirect URI with `error=access_denied` instead.

Note: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform
step 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end
user.

### Step 3: Token exchange

The `code` obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token
and refresh token.  Here is an example token exchange in Python:

    import datetime, pytz, requests

    if 'error' in get_params:
        raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])

    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={
        'code': get_params['code'],
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
        'redirect_uri': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirect_uri',
        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',
        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',
    })
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()

    # Save these in your database associated with the user
    access_token = data['access_token']
    refresh_token = data['refresh_token']
    expires_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])

You now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.
When using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the
user has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.

## Refreshing an access token

Access tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the `'expires_in'` key in
the token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed.  It
would be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you
can use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access
token.  Replace the `code` parameter with `refresh_token`, change the value
`grant_type` from `authorization_code` to `refresh_token`, and omit the
`redirect_uri` parameter.

Example in Python:

    ...
    response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={
        'refresh_token': get_refresh_token(),
        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
        'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',
        'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',
    })
    ...

# Webhooks

In order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file
(even if it is in Test Model).
Each API webhook is associated with one API application, go to
<a href="/api-management/" target="_blank">here</a> to set up both API applications and webhooks!

Once you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.
Create a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!

## Webhooks setup

All fields under webhooks section are required.

**Callback URL**
Callback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.

**Secret token**
Secret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will
talk more about this later.

**Events**

Events is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.

Event name \| Event description
---------- \| -----------------
`APPOINTMENT_CREATE` \| We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created
`APPOINTMENT_MODIFY` \| We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified
`PATIENT_CREATE` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created
`PATIENT_MODIFY` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified
`PATIENT_PROBLEM_CREATE` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created
`PATIENT_PROBLEM_MODIFY` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified
`PATIENT_ALLERGY_CREATE` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created
`PATIENT_ALLERGY_MODIFY` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified
`PATIENT_MEDICATION_CREATE` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created
`PATIENT_MEDICATION_MODIFY` \| We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified
`CLINICAL_NOTE_LOCK` \| We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked
`CLINICAL_NOTE_UNLOCK` \| We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked
`TASK_CREATE` \| We will deliver a hook any time a task is created
`TASK_MODIFY` \| We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item
`TASK_DELETE` \| We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted


## Webhooks verification

In order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification
step before we send any hooks out to you.

Verification can be done by clicking "Verify webhook" button in webhooks setup page. After you click
the button, we will send a `GET` request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called `msg`.

Please use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the `msg` value with
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104.html">HMAC algorithm</a>.
And we expect a `200` JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called `secret_token` existing, and its value should be
equal to the <strong>hashed</strong> `msg`. Otherwise, verification will fail.

Here is an example webhook verification in Python:

    import hashlib, hmac

    def webhook_verify(request):
        secret_token = hmac.new(WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
        return json_response({
            'secret_token': secret_token
        })

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<b>Note:</b> Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.
</div>


## Webhooks header and body

**Header**

Key \| Value
--- \| -----
`X-drchrono-event` \| Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or `PING`
`X-drchrono-signature` \| Secret token associated with this webhook
`X-drchrono-delivery` \| ID of this delivery

**Body**

Key \| Value
--- \| -----
`receiver` \| This will be an JSON representation of the webhook
`object` \| This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API

## Webhooks ping and deliveries

Webhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as `POST` requests.

**PING**:

You can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the "Ping webhook" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header `X-drchrono-event: PING` would be sent to the callback URL.

**Deliveries**:

You can check recent deliveries by clicking the "deliveries" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking "redeliver" button after select a specific delivery.

## Webhooks delivery mechanism

We will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.
However we only consider the response status code. We will consider any `2xx` responses as successfully delivered.
Any other responses, like `302` would be considered failing.
And we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,
second receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.
After these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.


## Webhooks security

You may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where <code>secret_token</code> is needed in
request header.
Try to set the <code>secret_token</code> to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of
<code>ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'</code>.
After this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.


# iframe integration

Some API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data
not offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's
patient information page via iframe.  We have created a simple API to make this
possible.

To make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient
page, you need to update either "Patient iframe" or "Clinical note iframe" section in API management page,
to make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),
with the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should
have. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it
is functional and secure.

## Register a Doctor

iframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient
page for doctors registered with your application.  To register a doctor with
your application, make a `POST` request to the `/api/iframe_integration`
endpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not
expect any payload.

To disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a `DELETE` request to the
same endpoint.

## Populating the iframe

There are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the
patient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:

<img src="" alt="Iframe on the patient page"/>

<img src="" alt="Iframe on the clinical note page"/>

When requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or
both of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame
contents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various
query parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the `src`
parameter of the IFrame will be:

```
<iframe_url>?doctor_id=<doctor_id>&patient_id=<patient_id>&practice_id=<practice_id>&iat=<iat>&jwt=<jwt>
```

The `jwt` parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and
does not implement its own login system.  It encapsulates the other parameters
in a [JSON web token (JWT)](http://jwt.io) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC
with your `client_secret` as the key.  This verifies that the iframe is being
loaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user.  In production, you
should validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the
[official site](http://jwt.io)), and only use the parameters extracted from the
JWT.  Using Python and Django, this might look like:

    import jwt

    CLIENT_SECRET = <client_secret>
    MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS = 60

    def validate_parameters(request):
        token = request.GET['jwt']

        return jwt.decode(token, CLIENT_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAX_TIME_DRIFT_SECONDS)

Modern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between
your application and drchrono's page through the iframe.  Therefore, interaction
must happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.

# Versions and deprecation

## Stability Policy

Changes to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing
endpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.

## Deprecation Policy

The drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:

* **Active:** This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by
our API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do
not break backwards compatibility.

* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been
surpassed by our active API version. An API version remains in this state for one year,
after which time it falls to the not supported state. A deprecated API version is passively supported;
while it won't be removed until becoming unsupported, it may not receive new features but will likely
be subject to security updates and performance improvements.

* **Unsupported:** An API version in the not supported state may be deactivated at any
time. An application using an unsupported API version should migrate to an active API version.

## Version Map

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/activities?moleculeChemblId=CHEMBL465983 -> will provide ChEMBL bio-interactions related information including targets and bio-activity measurements associated with molecule chembl id 'CHEMBL465983'

**Knowledge graphs**
Another use case of CROssBAR's API endpoints is in building knowledge graphs. These endpoints can be *weaved* together (output from one API endpoint fed as input to another API endpoint) programmatically to link nodes like protein, disease, drugs etc. as nodes of the graph. The endpoints are designed to be independent from each other which allows users the flexibility to drive biological networks from any facet e.g drug-centric, disease-centric, gene-centric etc. Our service for knowledge graph construction is available at https://crossbar.kansil.org.
An example for the part of the background queries on the CROssBAR API during the construction of a knowledge graph, 
(with the aim of keeping the example simple, we have only included the processes related to pathways, genes/proteins and drugs/compounds)
In this example, we would like to find bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to "WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking" pathway (based on Reactome pathway annotations).
This can be achieved by using endpoints listed on this swagger documentation as illustrated in following steps-
Find bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to "WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking" pathway (based on Reactome annotations)
This can be achieved by using endpoints listed on [this swagger documentation](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/swagger-ui.html) as illustrated in following steps-
1. Get all proteins from “/proteins” API endpoint which have a reactome pathway name equal to "WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking".
2. From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we query “/targets” API endpoint to obtain the ‘target_chembl_id’s of these proteins.
3. From the collection of target_chembl_ids collected from step 2 above, we query “/activities” API endpoint with pChEMBL value >=6, to obtain the ’molecule_chembl_id’s of the molecules that we need. 
4. From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we find out Drug names and ids from the “/drugs” API endpoint that targets our proteins.
5. From the collection of ’molecule_chembl_id’s obtained in step3, we query “/molecules” endpoint to get the compounds that are interacting with the genes/proteins belonging to the “WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking” pathway. | No | Yes | Unknown |

# API Documentation

## Instant Payments Notifications

IPN (Instant payment notifications, or callbacks) are used to notify you when transaction status is changed.  
To use them, you should complete the following steps:

1.  Generate and save the IPN Secret key in Store Settings tab at the Dashboard.
2.  Insert your URL address where you want to get callbacks in create_payment request. The parameter name is ipn_callback_url. You will receive payment updates (statuses) to this URL address.
3.  You will receive all the parameters at the URL address you specified in (2) by POST request.  
    The POST request will contain the *x-nowpayments-sig* parameter in the header.  
    The body of the request is similiar to a [get payment status](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7907941/S1a32n38?version=latest#0b77a8e3-2344-4760-a0bd-247da067db6d) response body.  
    Example:  
    {"payment_id":5077125051,"payment_status":"waiting","pay_address":"0xd1cDE08A07cD25adEbEd35c3867a59228C09B606","price_amount":170,"price_currency":"usd","pay_amount":155.38559757,"actually_paid":0,"pay_currency":"mana","order_id":"2","order_description":"Apple Macbook Pro 2019 x 1","purchase_id":"6084744717","created_at":"2021-04-12T14:22:54.942Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T14:23:06.244Z","outcome_amount":1131.7812095,"outcome_currency":"trx"}
4.  Sort all the parameters from the POST request in alphabetical order.
5.  Convert them to string using  
    [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) (params, Object.keys(params).sort()) or the same function.
6.  Sign a string with an IPN-secret key with HMAC and sha-512 key
7.  Compare the signed string from the previous step with the x-nowpayments-sig , which is stored in the header of the callback request.  
    If these strings are similar it is a success.  
    Otherwise, contact us on [support@nowpayments.io](mailto:support@nowpayments.io) to solve the problem.
    

Example of creating a signed string at Node.JS

```
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', notificationsKey);
hmac.update(JSON.stringify(params, Object.keys(params).sort()));
const signature = hmac.digest('hex');

```

Example of comparing signed strings in PHP

```
function check_ipn_request_is_valid()
    {
        $error_msg = "Unknown error";
        $auth_ok = false;
        $request_data = null;
        if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG']) && !empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'])) {
            $recived_hmac = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_NOWPAYMENTS_SIG'];
            $request_json = file_get_contents('php://input');
            $request_data = json_decode($request_json, true);
            ksort($request_data);
            $sorted_request_json = json_encode($request_data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES);
            if ($request_json !== false && !empty($request_json)) {
                $hmac = hash_hmac("sha512", $sorted_request_json, trim($this->ipn_secret));
                if ($hmac == $recived_hmac) {
                    $auth_ok = true;
                } else {
                    $error_msg = 'HMAC signature does not match';
                }
            } else {
                $error_msg = 'Error reading POST data';
            }
        } else {
            $error_msg = 'No HMAC signature sent.';
        }
    }

```

## Recurrent payment notifications

If an error is detected, the payment is flagged and will receive additional recurrent notifications (number of recurrent notifications can be changed in your Store Settings-> Instant Payment Notifications).

If an error is received again during processing of the payment, recurrent notifications will be initiated again.

Example: "Timeout" is set to 1 minute and "Number of recurrent notifications" is set to 3.

Once an error is detected, you will receive 3 notifications at 1 minute intervals.

## Several payments for one order

If you want to create several payments for one Order you should do the following:

*   Create a payment for the full order amount.
*   Save "purchase_id" which will be in "create_payment" response
*   Create next payment or payments with this "purchase_id" in "create_payment" request.
*   **Only works for partially_paid payments**
    

It may be useful if you want to give your customers opportunity to pay a full order with several payments, for example, one part in BTC and one part in ETH. Also, if your customer accidentally paid you only part of a full amount, you can automatically ask them to make another payment.

## Definitions

### Organization
Organization is a group of workspaces owned by your account.

### Workspace
Workspace contains templates. Each workspace has access to their own templates and organization default templates.

### Master Workspace
Master Workspace is the main/default workspace of your Organization. The Master Workspace identifier is the email you signed up with.

### Default Template
Default template is a template that is available for all workspaces by default. You can set the template access type under Page Setup. If template has "Organization" access then your users can use them from the "New" menu in the Editor.

### Data Field
Data Field is a placeholder for the specific data in your JSON data set. In this example JSON you can access the buyer name using Data Field `{paymentDetails::buyerName}`. The separator between depth levels is :: (two colons). When designing the template you don’t have to know every Data Field, our editor automatically extracts all the available fields from your data set and provides an easy way to insert them into the template.
```
{
    "documentNumber": 1,
    "paymentDetails": {
        "method": "Credit Card",
        "buyerName": "John Smith"
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Item one"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Authentication
The PDF Generator API uses __JSON Web Tokens (JWT)__ to authenticate all API requests. These tokens offer a method to establish secure server-to-server authentication by transferring a compact JSON object with a signed payload of your account’s API Key and Secret.
When authenticating to the PDF Generator API, a JWT should be generated uniquely by a __server-side application__ and included as a __Bearer Token__ in the header of each request.

## Legacy Simple and Signature authentication
You can find our legacy documentation for Simple and Signature authentication [here](https://docs.pdfgeneratorapi.com/legacy).

<SecurityDefinitions />

## Accessing your API Key and Secret
You can find your __API Key__ and __API Secret__ from the __Account Settings__ page after you login to PDF Generator API [here](https://pdfgeneratorapi.com/login).

## Creating a JWT
JSON Web Tokens are composed of three sections: a header, a payload (containing a claim set), and a signature. The header and payload are JSON objects, which are serialized to UTF-8 bytes, then encoded using base64url encoding.

The JWT's header, payload, and signature are concatenated with periods (.). As a result, a JWT typically takes the following form:
```
{Base64url encoded header}.{Base64url encoded payload}.{Base64url encoded signature}
```

We recommend and support libraries provided on [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). While other libraries can create JWT, these recommended libraries are the most robust.

### Header
Property `alg` defines which signing algorithm is being used. PDF Generator API users HS256.
Property `typ` defines the type of token and it is always JWT.
```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### Payload
The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims  or the pieces of information being passed about the user and any metadata required.
It is mandatory to specify the following claims:
* issuer (`iss`): Your API key
* subject (`sub`): Workspace identifier
* expiration time (`exp`): Timestamp (unix epoch time) until the token is valid. It is highly recommended to set the exp timestamp for a short period, i.e. a matter of seconds. This way, if a token is intercepted or shared, the token will only be valid for a short period of time.

```
{
  "iss": "ad54aaff89ffdfeff178bb8a8f359b29fcb20edb56250b9f584aa2cb0162ed4a",
  "sub": "demo.example@actualreports.com",
  "exp": 1586112639
}
```

### Signature
To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.
```
HMACSHA256(
    base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
    base64UrlEncode(payload),
    API_SECRET)
```

### Putting all together
The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots. The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.
```

## Testing with JWTs
You can create a temporary token in [Account Settings](https://pdfgeneratorapi.com/account/organization) page after you login to PDF Generator API. The generated token uses your email address as the subject (`sub`) value and is valid for __5 minutes__.
You can also use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to generate test tokens for your API calls. These test tokens should never be used in production applications.

| [PhantAuth](https://phantauth.net) | Random User Generator + OpenID Connect Provider. Like Lorem Ipsum, but for user accounts and authentication.

The PhantAuth API documentation is available on the following API documentation sites:

- [apiary](https://phantauth.docs.apiary.io) (primary source)

- [speca](https://speca.io/phantauth/phantauth)

- [PhantAuth Developer Portal](https://www.phantauth.net/api)

### TL;DR

**PhantAuth was designed to simplify testing for applications using OpenID Connect authentication by making use of random generated users.**

endpoint  \| address
--------- \| -------
issuer    \| https://phantauth.net
discovery \| https://phantauth.net/.well-known/openid-configuration

credential    \| value
------------- \| -----
client_id     \| test.client
client_secret \| UTBcWwt5

## OpenID Connect

The OpenID Connect Provider of PhantAuth supports the flows listed in the OpenID Connect specifications (Hybrid, Implicit, Authorization Code), as well as the Resource Owner Password grant type, specified in the OAuth 2.0 specifications. PhantAuth as an OpenID Connect Provider can be integrated with a variety of web applications, mobil applications, and  backend applications. The integration can be either direct, as in the case of the OpenID Connect Provider, or through an authentication integration service, as in the case of Auth0 or Azure Active Directory B2C. To learn more, please go to chapter [Integration](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/integration).

Examples:

- [Direct OpenID Connect integration](https://www.phantauth.net/test/oidc)

- [Auth0 Social Connections integration](https://www.phantauth.net/test/auth0)

- [Azure Active Directory B2C integration](https://www.phantauth.net/test/azure)

## Random User

The random user generator of PhantAuth can also be used separately, independent of the OpenID Connect Provider. You can generate an optional number of test users. In the knowledge of their user name, the data of the generated users can be regenerated at any time (OpenID Connect *sub* claim). The generated users have a unique, operational, disposable email address, a profile picture selected from one of the multiple pools of pictures, and the usual profile data. Custom email addresses and profile pictures may also be added. The random user generator of PhantAuth can be fully customized. Additionally, you can link an external generator to the application. For details,please go to chapter [Generator](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/generator).

Test pages:

- [Default Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/test/user) (embedded generator)

- [Greek Gods Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_gods/test/user) (embedded generator working from a Google Sheet)

- [Faker Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_faker/test/user) (external generator using Javascript Faker library)

- [Chance Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_chance/test/user) (external generator using Javascript Chance library)

- [Casual Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_casual/test/user) (external generator using Javascript Casual library)

- [Randomuser Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_randomuser/test/user) (client side generator using https://randomuser.me)

- [uinames Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_uinames/test/user) (client side generator using https://uinames.com)

- [Mockaroo Generator Test Page](https://phantauth.net/_mockaroo/test/user) (client side generator using https://mockaroo.com)

Every random generated user has a profile page, which contains their profile data in a simple one-page format.

Profile examples:

- [Random Profile](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe.black)

- [Random Greek God Profile](https://phantauth.net/_gods/%7Ezeus)

- [Random Faker Profile](https://phantauth.net/_faker/%7Eharry.houdini)

- [Random Chance Profile](https://phantauth.net/_chance/%7Epeter.pan)

- [Random Casual Profile](https://phantauth.net/_casual/%7Ejohn.smith)

## CodeSandbox

The use of the random user generator and the direct integration of  the OpenID Connect is demonstrated through a set of CodeSandbox samples. The sample applications are run directly from CodeSandbox, so the source code is easy to view, edit, and test.

Examples:

- [Random User Generator usage exampe](https://4xyj8lw394.codesandbox.io/)

- [OpenID Connect direct integration exampe](https://8z77681269.codesandbox.io/)

## Tenants

The PhantAuth is extremely versatile and customizable. You can use your own random user service, or generate users from an external .csv file or Google Sheet. You can use a set of Bootstrap themes to tailor the look and feel of the profile, morover, you can fundamentally change the same look and feel by the use of your own HTML templates. To find out more, please go to chapter [Tenant](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/tenant).

To customize the application, you need to use one or more so-called tenants. A tenant can be consiered as an independent PhantAuth service. A tenant has its own random user generator endpoints and OpenID Connect endpoints.

The tenants can be organised into so-called domains. Practically, a domain is a DNS zone, which contains the settings of the given tenant(s). The tenants as well as the domain can be configured by the use of DNS TXT records.

In addition to the default tenant, the PhantAuth domain contains some sample tenants, which are primarily designed to demonstrate customizability, a range of hosting possibilities, and the links to external services. In most cases, using the [default tenant](https://phantauth.net) is enough.

- [PhantAuth Default](https://phantauth.net) - default tenant, based on a Java Fairy library

- [Greek Gods](https://phantauth.net/_gods) - based on a Google Sheet document

- [PhantAuth Faker](https://phantauth.net/_faker) - based on a Javascript Faker library, hosted at https://now.sh

- [PhantAuth Chance](https://phantauth.net/_chance) - based on a Javascript Chance library, hosted at https://now.sh

- [PhantAuth Casual](https://phantauth.net/_casual) - based on a Javascript Casual library, hosted at https://webtask.io

- [RANDOM USER](https://phantauth.net/_randomuser) - based on https://randomuser.me service

- [uinames](https://phantauth.net/_uinames) - based on https://uinames.com service

- [Mockaroo](https://phantauth.net/_mockaroo) - based on  https://mockaroo.com service

Anyone can create a domain and the tenants. Sharing the tenants is facilitated by the [PhantAuth Shared Domain](https://shared.phantauth.net). A shared domain is connected to the [phantauth.cf](http://phantauth.cf) DNS zone, where anyone can create tenant configuration nodes by the use of the [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) service.

### Concept

The internal structure of PhantAuth is modular enough to allow certain elements to be customized or even replaced. The customized PhantAuth instances can be considered as separate services, which are independent from the original one. For the sake of simplicity, the customized PhantAuth instances will be called **tenants**.

The customized PhantAuth instances (tenants) have a different URL from that of the default tenant. For technological and cloud hosting purposes, it is advised that only the beginning of the path component of these URLs differs from the default PhantAuth URL. Similarly, the path component of a tenant URL should start with a low line character ("_"). So the general format of a tenant URL is:

```
https://phantauth.net/_TENANT
```

where `TENANT` is the name of the tenant. The tenant name is a DNS domain name at the same time, which may lack `.phantauth.net` or `.phantauth.cf` from the end.

### DNS for configuration

When desiging PhantAuth, the aim is that PhantAuth can run without a database, and it is configurable by the users. This can be achieved if for the purpose of storing the tenant configuration, the system uses the special TXT records of the Domain Name System (DNS), in compliance with the [RFC 6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763) specifications. So the tenant name is one or more DNS TXT records. These TXT records contain the configuration properties in NAME=VALUE format.

This allows anyone to create their own tenants by creating a DNS domain and the TXT records in that domain. [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com), a service provider, allows you to register some top-level domains (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq) free charge. The domain registered this way can be managed on the online interface of Freenom or transferred to an other free service provider offering a more convenient DNS name server (e.g. [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)). Additionally, [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) allows you to create DNS records within a second- or third level domain that is privately owned or shared with a community. In this case, you are advised to create the entries within the `phantauth.cf` domain, because here you can omit the `.phantauth.cf` from the tenant name in the URL. This means that a tenant with a name of `mytenant.phantauth.cf` can be referred to in the shorther `https://phantauth.net/_mytenant` format, rather than the longer `https://phantauth.net/_mytenant.phantauth.cf` URL . Similar to `.phantauth.cf`, the `phantauth.net` can be omitted, thus the officially supported and the example tenants can be referred to by their short names (e.g. https://phantauth.net/_faker).

In a nutshell, to create a tenant, you have the following options:

- With TXT records in a domain registered at Freenom, either on the online interface of Freenom or that of another free DNS service provider (e.g. CloudFlare).

- With TXT records created in a second- or third level domain shared with a community, by using FreeDNS.

- With TXT records created in your own existing DNS domain, by the use of an any DNS software.

### Parameters

The below table contains a summary of the tenant parameters having an effect on the operation of the tenants.

Property \| Description
--- \| ---
[name](#name) \| the displayed name of the tenant
[flags](#flags) \| generator flags having an effect on the login page
[theme](#theme) \| the address of the Bootstrap theme
[template](#template) \| the address of the HTML page templates
[factory](#factory) \| the address of the external user generator
[depot](#depot) \| the address of the external user database
[sheet](#sheet) \| the identifier of the Google Sheets document containing the user database
[script](#script) \| the JavaScript URL inserted in the HTML pages
[summary](#summary) \| a one-line summary of the tenant
[about](#about) \| a detailed description of the tenant
[attribution](#attribution) \| the specifications of the external source
[logo](#logo) \| the logo of the tenant
[favicon](#favicon) \| the favicon of the tenant's web pages

#### name

The displayed name of the tenant is defined in the `name` parameter. In lack of such a name, the tenant's DNS name is displayed. This name appears in the address bar of the tenant's webpages.

#### flags

This parameter contains the flags that affect the operation of a tenant (see [Flags](generator.md#flags)). Currently, the flags affecting the team size are used in the login screen. If any of the flags is a team size flag, you can select the user from a list in the login screen, rather than using an input field. It can take the following values:

- tiny

- small

- medium

- large

#### theme

The HTML page templates of a tenant are created by the use of the Bootstrap library. This allows you to customize the layout and the colours of the pages by using external Bootstrap CSS files. The `theme` parameter contains the URL of the Bootstrap CSS file used in the pages. It is optional; in lack of such a parameter, the tenant's HTML pages have the default layout provided in the [PhantAuth developer portal](https://www.phantauth.net).

#### template

The place of the HTML page templates of a tenant is specified by the `template` parameter. The value of the parameter is n [RFC 6570 - URI temaplate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) expression. The URI template receives the page name in a `resource` parameter.

The default value of the `template` parameter:

```
https://default.phantauth.net{/resource}
```

The `resource` URI template parameter may take the following values:

Value \| Description
--- \| ---
tenant.html \| the tenant's webpage; it contains a short description and the entry points of the tenant 
user.html \| the user's profile page
login.html \| the login page used for signing in
consent.html \| the content page used for signing in
team.html \| the profile page of the user group
client.html \| the profile page of a client
fleet.html \| the profile page of the client group
policy.html \| the client's privacy policy
tos.html \| a client's terms of service
test.html \| a login test page of the user generator and OpenID Connect

If you use your own template, the pages are fully customizable. The templates use a template engine called [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/), which provides flexible template options. The source of the default template is available in the [phantauth-default](https://github.com/phantauth/phantauth-default) GitHub repository. If you wish to create your own templates, you are advised to produce them from these templates.

#### factory

PhantAuth allows you to use your own random resource (user, team) generator. To do so, you need to provide its address in the `factory` tenant parameter. The value of the parameter is an [RFC 6570 - URI temaplate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) expression. The URI template receives the type of the object (user, team) to be generated in the `kind` parameter, and the identifier of the object to be generated in the `name` parameter.

#### factories

In the `factories` parameter, you can specify the resource types that can be generated by the external generator set in the `factory` parameter. It takes the value of one or more strings from the following: `user`, `team`.

#### depot

Instead of generating a user and team resource, you can randomly select them from a pre-created inventory. In this case, the URL of the CSV file containing the resources can be specified in the `depot` parameter. The value of the parameter is an [RFC 6570 - URI temaplate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) expression. The URI template receives the type of the object (user, team) to be generated in the `kind` parameter.

The first line of the CSV file contains the resource property names, the following lines, on the other hand, contain the relevant data.
In the case of nested properties, a "." character separates the elements of the property name (e.g. address.formatted).

#### depots

In the `depots` parameter, you can specify the purpose of the external source set in the `depot` parameter. It takes the value of one or more strings from the following: `user`, `team`.

#### sheet

You can randomly select the user data from a Google Sheets document. In the `sheet` parameter, you can specify the identifier of a public Google Sheets document. The first row of the table contains the user property names, the following rows contain the relating data. In the case of nested properties, a "." character is used to separate the elements of the property name (e.g. address.formatted).

The tenant named `gods` is an example for the use of the `sheet` parameter. It provides the user data in a [public Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xa4mRcLWroJr2vUDhrJXGBcobYmpS8fNZxFpXw-M9DY/) document. In this case, the identifier of the sheet is `1Xa4mRcLWroJr2vUDhrJXGBcobYmpS8fNZxFpXw-M9DY`, and the associated TXT record is:

```
gods    120 IN  TXT "sheet=1Xa4mRcLWroJr2vUDhrJXGBcobYmpS8fNZxFpXw-M9DY"
```

#### script

You can automatically insert a custom JavaScript file in the login.html, consent.html, and test.html pages. The URL of this file can be specified in the `script` parameter. By inserting a custom JavaScript file, you can also integrate a client-side random user generator.

#### summary

You can provide a short, one-line description, a watchword for the tenant in the `summary` parameter. It appears on the tenant's startup page and all the pages that contain a list of available tenants.

#### about

To provide a detailed description of the tenant, use the `about` parameter. If it takes the value of a URL, the description is downloaded from the given URL; otherwise the value is the description itself. The description may have markdown formatting.

#### attribution

It is an external data source. If you use a random user generator, you can specify the attribution in the `attribution` parameter. The attribution may have markdown formatting, that is, you can highlight any element or provide a link to an external source:

```
randomuser  120 IN  TXT "attribution=User data generated using [RANDOM USER GENERATOR](https://randomuser.me/)."
```

#### logo

It is the URL of the tenant's logo. The image at this address appears in the address bar of the tenant's webpages.

#### favicon

Use the `favicon` parameter to provide the URL of the favicon. The image at this address appears as a shortcut icon in the browser when a user visits the tenant's webpages.

### Examples

PhantAuth offers several examples for creating a custom tenant. They are ready-to-use tenants, although primarily created to show examples for customization.

## Generator

The basic concept of PhantAuth is that it generates data in a random but deterministic way. To achieve this goal, a so-called pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used. Each object type has an identifier (login name for user, client_id for client, etc.) By using a given hash algorithm, the value of the pseudorandom generator seed is produced from this identifier. Then, every property of the given object is generated with the pseudorandom generator started from this seed value. Taking advantage of the special feature of the pseudorandom number generator, also called as deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), that is, it generates the same random value series started from the same seed, the identifier clearly defines the object generated from it. That is, by the use of an identifier and generator, you can regenarate the properties of a given object at any time.

Based on the above concept, PhantAuth is absolutely stateless, and no storage medium is necessary. So, a randomly selected login name will "exist", and the properties of the "associated" user can be generated.

### Identifier

In brief, an object is defined by its identifier. The name of the identifier of a user or client object is `sub` or `client_id` used in the OpenID Connect specifications. The name of the identifier property of other PhantAuth-specific objects that are not included in the specifications is `sub`.

The identifier may contain any character.

### Customization

Sometimes you may want to customize the properties generated from the identifier. Although the identifier may contain any character, and its structure is optional, you can customize the generated values if a certain structure is used.

#### Flags

You can use a variety of flags to customize or give the parameters of certain object properties (user, client, etc.). The flags can be grouped by their effect on the generation of the properties. Basically, a flag is a keyword. You can set more than one flags to affect the generation of a variety of properties at the same time. To separate the flags from one another and the rest of the identifier, you need to use a semicolon `;`:

```
joe;female;kitten
```

In the above example, the user generated by the user generator is female, and her avatar is a randomly selected sketched kitten avatar. The other features are deterministically generated from the name "joe", that is, their values are not affected by the two flags. The [profile page](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe%3bfemale%3bkitten) of this example can be found [here](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe%3bfemale%3bkitten).

Please note that the flags form part of the identifier, as a different flag allows you to generate a different object.

##### User gender flags

The following flags modify the gender of the generated user.

Flag \| Description
--- \| ---
male \| The `gender` property of the generated user is male, independent of the user's name
female \| The `gender` property of the generated user is female, independent of the user's name
guess \| The `gender` property is defined on the basis of the generated user's given name (default)
nogender \| The generated user doesn't have a `gender` property

##### User avatar flags

The following flags modify the generated avatar image.

#### Name

In most cases, the generated objects have a full name, which is generated from the identifier. Instead of being generated, the full name can be produced from the identifier, if the identifier contains at least one period (`.`) or space (` `) character. In such cases, these characters play the role of separator between the parts of the full name (e.g. family name, given name). That is, the full name isn't randomly generated from the identifier but, by taking the separator characters into account,  it is produced from the single parts of the full name (with capitalised initial letters). For this purpose, it is advised to use a period character, rather than a space character.

```
joe.black;sketch
```

In the above example: The full name of the user generated by the user generator is *Joe Black* (and his avatar is a skecthed profile avatar). The [profile page](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe.black%3bsketch) of this example can be found [here](https://phantauth.net/%7Ejoe.black%3bsketch).

#### Picture

In most cases, the generated objects have an image (avatar for a user, logo for a client), which is generated from the identifier. The *flags* determine which pre-defined inventory the image comes from (see [flags](#flags)). It can be further customized by the use of [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com).

Each object has a generated unique email address (`email` for a user, `logo_email` for any other objects). To customize the image of a given object, you need to assign the gravatar image to this email address. By default, an object has a gravatar image, and the generated image is the default value of the gravatar URL only. In other words, as soon as you create a gravatar image to a given email address, that image will appear as the image associated with the given object.

#### Email

A disposable, operational email address suitable for receiving incoming emails is generated to each object. You can use your own email address (e.g. a previously set test email address) instead of a generated email address, if you prefer. In this case, the identifier contains an email address. Consequently, the image associated with the given object is the gravatar image assigned to the email address contained in the identifier.

```
ivan.test.szkiba@spam4.me
```

In the above example: The email address of the user generated by the user generator is *ivan.test.szkiba@spam4.me* (and his name is *Ivan Test Szkiba*). The [profile page](https://phantauth.net/%7Eivan.test.szkiba%40spam4.me) of this example can be found [here](https://phantauth.net/%7Eivan.test.szkiba%40spam4.me).

### Custom Generators

PhantAuth can use external data sources and generators as well. The only restriction is that the external generator has to be deterministic. This means that even if called several times, it has to generate the same object to the same identifier.

A special case of external generators is if an external data source is used. In such cases, the properties of a given object can be provided in a comma separated value (CSV) file or a Google Sheets document.

The external data sources and generators can be defined by the use of so-called [tenants](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/tenant). To learn more, please go to chapter [Tenant](https://doc.phantauth.net/#/tenant). | No | Yes | Unknown |

| [Rebilly REST API](https://www.rebilly.com/contact/) | # Introduction
The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
and [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk)).

We have other APIs that are also available.  Every action from our [app](https://app.rebilly.com)
is supported by an API which is documented and available for use so that you
may automate any workflows necessary.  This document contains the most commonly
integrated resources.

# Authentication

When you sign up for an account, you are given your first secret API key.
You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  secret key, publishable key, JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.
- [Secret API key](#section/Authentication/SecretApiKey): used for requests made
  from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
- [Publishable API key](#section/Authentication/PublishableApiKey): used for 
  requests from the client side. For now can only be used to create 
  a [Payment Token](#operation/PostToken) and 
  a [File token](#operation/PostFile).
- [JWT](#section/Authentication/JWT): short lifetime tokens that can be assigned a specific expiration time.

Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.

&lt;!-- ReDoc-Inject: &lt;security-definitions&gt; --&gt;

# Errors
Rebilly follow's the error response format proposed in [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) also known as Problem Details for HTTP APIs.  As with our normal API responses, your client must be prepared to gracefully handle additional members of the response.

## Forbidden
&lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/Forbidden"} /&gt;

## Conflict
&lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/Conflict"} /&gt;

## NotFound
&lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/NotFound"} /&gt;

## Unauthorized
&lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/Unauthorized"} /&gt;

## ValidationError
&lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/ValidationError"} /&gt;

# SDKs

Rebilly offers a Javascript SDK and a PHP SDK to help interact with
the API.  However, no SDK is required to use the API.

Rebilly also offers [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/),
 a client-side iFrame-based solution to help
create payment tokens while minimizing PCI DSS compliance burdens
and maximizing the customizability. [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/)
is interacting with the [payment tokens creation operation](#operation/PostToken).

## Javascript SDK

Installation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/sdks).
SDK code examples are included in these docs.

## PHP SDK
For all PHP SDK examples provided in these docs you will need to configure the `$client`.
You may do it like this:

```php
$client = new Rebilly\Client([
    'apiKey' =&gt; 'YourApiKeyHere',
    'baseUrl' =&gt; 'https://api.rebilly.com',
]);
```

# Using filter with collections
Rebilly provides collections filtering. You can use `?filter` param on collections to define which records should be shown in the response.

Here is filter format description:

- Fields and values in filter are separated with `:`: `?filter=firstName:John`.

- Sub-fields are separated with `.`: `?filter=billingAddress.country:US`.

- Multiple filters are separated with `;`: `?filter=firstName:John;lastName:Doe`. They will be joined with `AND` logic. In this example: `firstName:John` AND `lastName:Doe`.

- You can use multiple values using `,` as values separator: `?filter=firstName:John,Bob`. Multiple values specified for a field will be joined with `OR` logic. In this example: `firstName:John` OR `firstName:Bob`.

- To negate the filter use `!`: `?filter=firstName:!John`. Note that you can negate multiple values like this: `?filter=firstName:!John,!Bob`. This filter rule will exclude all Johns and Bobs from the response.

- You can use range filters like this: `?filter=amount:1..10`.

- You can use gte (greater than or equals) filter like this: `?filter=amount:1..`, or lte (less than or equals) than filter like this: `?filter=amount:..10`. This also works for datetime-based fields.

- You can create some [predefined values lists](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/Lists) and use them in filter: `?filter=firstName:@yourListName`. You can also exclude list values: `?filter=firstName:!@yourListName`.

- Datetime-based fields accept values formatted using RFC 3339 like this: `?filter=createdTime:2021-02-14T13:30:00Z`. 

# Expand to include embedded objects
Rebilly provides the ability to pre-load additional 
objects with a request. 

You can use `?expand` param on most requests to expand
and include embedded objects within the
`_embedded` property of the response.

The `_embedded` property contains an array of 
objects keyed by the expand parameter value(s).

You may expand multiple objects by passing them
as comma-separated to the expand value like so:

```
?expand=recentInvoice,customer
```

And in the response, you would see:

```
"_embedded": [
    "recentInvoice": {...},
    "customer": {...}
]
```
Expand may be utilitized not only on `GET` requests but also on `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT` requests too.


# Getting started guide

Rebilly's API has over 300 operations.  That's more than you'll 
need to implement your use cases.  If you have a use 
case you would like to implement, please consult us for
feedback on the best API operations for the task.

Our getting started guide will demonstrate a basic order form use
case.  It will allow us to highlight core resources
in Rebilly that will be helpful for many other use cases
too.

- インストールフックの呼び出し

### インストールフック
アプリのインストール時に、インストールに関する情報を `POST` メソッド、 `application/json` 形式で通知します。
通知先のURLは[カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/)にログインし、各アプリストア アプリのアプリ設定から登録を行ってください。

以下のパラメータが送信されます。課金請求に必要なパラメータを含みますので、必ず受け取れるようにしてください。

\|パラメータ\|機能\|形式\|
\|---\|---\|---\|
\|`account_id`\|インストールしたショップオーナーのアカウントID\|PA+8桁の整数\|
\|`application_charge_source_id`\|プラン課金ID\|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)\|
\|`recurring_application_charge_id`\|（買い切り以外の課金の場合）課金契約ID\|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)\|
\|`application_charge_id`\|（買い切りの場合）課金契約ID\|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)\|
\|`trial_term`\|（無料お試し期間がある場合）無料お試し期間\|JSONオブジェクト\|
\|`mail`\|ショップオーナーへの連絡メールアドレス\|文字列\|

`application_charge_source_id` はデベロッパーサイトで設定したプラン課金のIDです。インストールされた料金プランの判別にご利用いただけます。

`recurring_application_charge_id` と `application_charge_id` はインストールごとに発行されるユニークなIDです。ショップオーナーが一度アンインストールした後に、再度同じショップオーナーがアプリのインストールを行った際には新たに別のIDが発行されます。

`recurring_application_charge_id` は「買い切り」以外の課金である「無料」「月額」「月額＋従量」「月額＋初期費用」「従量のみ」のプラン課金のインストールの際に発行されます。

従量による課金を伴うプラン課金の場合は、従量分の料金を請求する際に 課金契約ID(`recurring_application_charge_id`) が必要になるので、必ず記録するようにしてください。

`mail` パラメータの値はショップオーナーへの連絡手段としてご利用いただけます。インストール後に認可フローが中断され、アクセストークンが得られない際のショップオーナーへの連絡手段としてご活用いただけます。このパラメータはカラーミーショップの非公開情報として登録されている値です。左記以外の用途でこの値をアプリの機能で使用しないでください。

例) 買い切りの場合
```
{
  "account_id": "PA00000001",
  "application_charge_source_id": "F3RN9A",
  "application_charge_id": "A3FT4N",
  "mail": "shop@example.com"
}
```

例) 月額課金の場合
```
{
  "account_id": "PA00000001",
  "application_charge_source_id": "F3RN9A",
  "recurring_application_charge_id": "A3FT4N",
  "mail": "shop@example.com"
}
```

無料お試し期間を設定した課金の場合、以下の情報を `trial_term` パラメータとして送信します。
無料お試し期間中は従量課金APIを呼び出して課金請求することはできません。

\|パラメータ\|機能\|形式\|
\|---\|---\|---\|
\|`starts_at`\|無料お試し開始日時\|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)\|
\|`ends_at`\|無料お試し終了日時\|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)\|

例) 無料お試し期間がある月額課金の場合
```
{
  "account_id": "PA00000001",
  "application_charge_source_id": "F3RN9A",
  "recurring_application_charge_id": "A3FT4N",
  "mail": "shop@example.com",
  "trial_term" {
    "starts_at": 1565017200,
    "ends_at": 1567609200
  }
}
```

受け取りに成功した場合は、以下のパラメータを `application/json` 形式でレスポンスボディに付与し、
ステータスコード `200` レスポンスをカラーミーショップへ返却してください。
ステータスコード `200` レスポンスをカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合、もしくは以下のパラメーターが返却されなかった場合、インストールを中止し、インストールによって発生した情報は破棄されます。

\|パラメータ\|機能\|形式\|
\|---\|---\|---\|
\|`redirect_url`\|インストール成功後に遷移するURL\|文字列（URL）\|

例)
```
{
  "redirect_url": "https://example.com"
}
```
インストール完了後、インストールフックのレスポンスパラメータの `redirect_url` へ画面遷移しますので、APIを利用する場合は `redirect_url` より先の画面でOAuth認証の実装をお願いします。

## アプリのアンインストール
ショップオーナーがアプリをアンインストールしたとき、以下の処理をカラーミーショップが行います。
- OAuth認証のアクセストークンの無効化
- 登録したインラインスクリプトタグ・スクリプトタグの削除
- 月額課金形式の場合、継続課金の無効化

### アンインストールフック
アンインストール直後に `POST` メソッドで、以下の情報を `application/json` 形式で通知します。
通知先のURLは[カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/)にログインし、各アプリストア アプリのアプリ設定から登録を行ってください。

※ [アンインストールAPI](#operation/deleteInstallation)のご利用によるアンインストール時はアンインストールフックは通知されません。

受け取りに成功した場合はステータスコード `200` のレスポンスを返却してください。

\|パラメータ\|機能\|形式\|
\|---\|---\|---\|
\|`account_id`\|アンインストールしたショップオーナーのアカウントID\|PA+8桁の整数\|
\|`application_charge_source_id`\|プラン課金ID\|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)\|
\|`uninstalled_at`\|アンインストール日時\|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)\|
\|`reason`\|アンインストール理由\| `by_shop_owner` (ショップオーナーによる)<br /> `by_unpaid` (未払いによる) \|
\|`recurring_application_charge_id`\|（買い切り以外の課金の場合）課金契約ID\|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)\|
\|`usage_charge`\|（従量課金の場合）従量課金アンインストール情報\|JSONオブジェクト\|

アンインストールフックの通知が伴うアンインストールは以下の操作のいずれかによって行われます。アンインストールの理由を `reason` パラメータで確認できます。

\|reasonパラメータの値\|アンインストール理由\|
\|---\|---\|
\|`by_shop_owner`\|ショップオーナーによるアンインストール操作\|
\|`by_unpaid`\|ポイント不足による利用料徴収の失敗による自動アンインストール\|

課金契約ID `recurring_application_charge_id` はインストールフックで通知したIDと同じIDが通知されます。

料金プランが従量課金の場合、アンインストール後に従量課金データの作成を可能にするために、以下の情報を `usage_charge` パラメータとして送信します。
アンインストール後はOAuthのアクセストークンが無効化されているため、アクセストークンを利用して従量課金APIを呼び出すことができなくなります。
アンインストール後はアクセストークンの代わりに `api_token` をリクエストヘッダーに含め、従量課金APIを呼び出してください。
無料お試し期間中にアプリがアンインストールされた場合は、`api_token` は発行されません。
詳しくは、[従量課金データの作成](https://app.shop-pro.jp/open_api#operation/createUsageCharge)を参照してください。
`api_token` を利用した従量課金APIの呼び出しは、ポイント締め日 `closing_on` までとなっておりますので、ご注意ください。

\|パラメータ\|機能\|形式\|
\|---\|---\|---\|
\|`api_token`\|アンインストール後に従量課金APIを利用いただくために必要な情報\|文字列\|
\|`closing_on`\|ポイント締め日\|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)\|

通常、 `closing_on` は、アンインストール直前まで利用されていた契約の期間の月末となります。以下に例を示します。

\|アンインストール日\|直前まで利用されていた契約の期間\|closing_on の示す日時\|
\|---\|---\|---\|
\|2021/01/09\|2021/12/10〜2021/01/09\|2021/01/31\|
\|2021/01/10\|2021/01/10〜2021/02/09\|2021/02/28\|

従量課金の場合のユーザーの契約期間については[こちら](https://shop-pro.jp/manual/appstore_fee)をご参照ください

}
```

### アンインストールフックのリトライ
ステータスコード `200` のレスポンスをカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合は、ステータスコード `200` をカラーミーショップが受け取るまで、以下の条件で再度アンインストール情報を送信します。
なお、カラーミーショップによるアンインストール処理は、アンインストールフックの送信結果の成否によらず、アンインストールが実行されたときに完了します。

- 2時間30分ごとにアンインストールフックの仕様に基づき再送します
- 最大で合計19回再送します
- すべての再送の試行でステータスコード `200` をカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合は、公認デベロッパー申請時に登録されたメールアドレス宛にメールを送信します

## インストール・アンインストールフックの署名検証
`X-Appstore-Signature` リクエストヘッダーに含まれる署名を検証して、リクエストがカラーミーショップから送信されたことを確認することを推奨します。

検証の手順は以下のとおりです。

1. カラーミーショップが発行した `webhook_secret` を秘密鍵として、HMAC-SHA256アルゴリズムを使用してリクエストボディのダイジェスト値を取得します。
2. ダイジェスト値をBase64エンコードした値とリクエストヘッダーに付与された署名( `X-Appstore-Signature` の値）が一致することを確認します。


サンプルコード(ruby)
```ruby
WEBHOOK_SECRET = 'my_webhook_secret'

payload_body = request.body.read
signature = Base64.strict_encode64(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest('sha256', WEBHOOK_SECRET, payload_body))
ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(signature, request.env['HTTP_X_APPSTORE_SIGNATURE'])
```

| [Tisane API Documentation](https://tisane.ai) | Tisane is a natural language processing library, providing:

*   standard NLP functionality
*   special functions for detection of problematic or abusive content
*   low-level NLP like morphological analysis and tokenization of no-space languages (Chinese, Japanese, Thai)
    

Tisane has monolithic architecture. All the functions are exposed using the same language models and the same analysis process invoked using the [POST /parse](#561264c5-6dbe-4bde-aba3-7defe837989f) method. Other methods in the API are either wrappers based on the process, helper methods, or allow inspection of the language models.

The current section of the documentation describes the two structures used in the parsing & transformation methods.

# Getting Started

This guide describes how to setup your Tisane account. The steps you need to complete are as follows:

*   Step 1 – Create an Account
*   Step 2 – Save Your API Key
*   Step 3 – Integrate the API
    

## Step 1 – Create an Account

Navigate to [Sign up to Tisane API](https://tisane.ai/signup/). The free Community Plan allows up to 50,000 requests but comes with a limitation of 10 requests per minute.

## Step 2 - Save Your API Key

You will need the API key to make requests. Open your [Developer Profile](https://tisane.ai/developer/) to find your API keys.

## Step 3 - Integrate with the API

In summary, the POST /parse method has 3 attributes: *content*, *language*, and *settings*. All 3 attributes are mandatory.

For example:  
`{"language": "en", "content": "hello", "settings": {}}`

Read on for more info on the [response](#response-reference) and the [settings](#settings-reference) specs. The method doc pages contain snippets of code for your favorite languages and platforms.

# Response Reference

The response of the [POST /parse](#561264c5-6dbe-4bde-aba3-7defe837989f) method contains several sections displayed or hidden according to the [settings](#settings-reference) provided.

The common attributes are:

*   `text` (string) - the original input
*   `reduced_output` (boolean) - if the input is too big, and verbose information like the lexical chunk was requested, the verbose information will not be generated, and this flag will be set to `true` and returned as part of the response
*   `sentiment` (floating-point number) - a number in range -1 to 1 indicating the document-level sentiment. Only shown when `document_sentiment` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`.
*   `signal2noise` (floating-point number) - a signal to noise ranking of the text, in relation to the array of concepts specified in the `relevant` [setting](#settings-reference). Only shown when the `relevant` setting exists.
    

## Abusive or Problematic Content

The `abuse` section is an array of detected instances of content that may violate some terms of use. **NOTE**: the terms of use in online communities may vary, and so it is up to the administrators to determine whether the content is indeed abusive. For instance, it makes no sense to restrict sexual advances in a dating community, or censor profanities when it's accepted in the bulk of the community.

The section exists if instances of abuse are detected and the `abuse` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.

Every instance contains the following attributes:

*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts
*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the content
*   `sentence_index` (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance
*   `text` (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the `snippets` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`)
*   `tags` (array of strings) - when exists, provides additional detail about the abuse. For instance, if the fragment is classified as an attempt to sell hard drugs, one of the tags will be *hard_drug*.
*   `type` (string) - the type of the abuse
*   `severity` (string) - how severe the abuse is. The levels of severity are `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `extreme`
*   `explanation` (string) - when available, provides rationale for the annotation; set the `explain` setting to `true` to enable.
    

The currently supported types are:

*   `personal_attack` - an insult / attack on the addressee, e.g. an instance of cyberbullying. Please note that an attack on a post or a point, or just negative sentiment is not the same as an insult. The line may be blurred at times. See [our Knowledge Base for more information](http://tisane.ai/knowledgebase/how-do-i-detect-personal-attacks/).
*   `bigotry` - hate speech aimed at one of the [protected classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group). The hate speech detected is not just racial slurs, but, generally, hostile statements aimed at the group as a whole
*   `profanity` - profane language, regardless of the intent
*   `sexual_advances` - welcome or unwelcome attempts to gain some sort of sexual favor or gratification
*   `criminal_activity` - attempts to sell or procure restricted items, criminal services, issuing death threats, and so on
*   `external_contact` - attempts to establish contact or payment via external means of communication, e.g. phone, email, instant messaging (may violate the rules in certain communities, e.g. gig economy portals, e-commerce portals)
*   `adult_only` - activities restricted for minors (e.g. consumption of alcohol)
*   `mental_issues` - content indicative of suicidal thoughts or depression
*   `allegation` - claimed knowledge or accusation of a misconduct (not necessarily crime)
*   `provocation` - content likely to provoke an individual or a group
*   `disturbing` - graphic descriptions that may disturb readers
*   `no_meaningful_content` - unparseable gibberish without apparent meaning
*   `data_leak` - private data like passwords, ID numbers, etc.
*   `spam` - (RESERVED) spam content
*   `generic` - undefined
    

## Sentiment Analysis

The `sentiment_expressions` section is an array of detected fragments indicating the attitude towards aspects or entities.

The section exists if sentiment is detected and the `sentiment` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.

Every instance contains the following attributes:

*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts
*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the content
*   `sentence_index` (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance
*   `text` (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the `snippets` setting is set to `true`)
*   `polarity` (string) - whether the attitude is `positive`, `negative`, or `mixed`. Additionally, there is a `default` sentiment used for cases when the entire snippet has been pre-classified. For instance, if a review is split into two portions, *What did you like?* and *What did you not like?*, and the reviewer replies briefly, e.g. *The quiet. The service*, the utterance itself has no sentiment value. When the calling application is aware of the intended sentiment, the *default* sentiment simply provides the targets / aspects, which will be then added the sentiment externally.
*   `targets` (array of strings) - when available, provides set of aspects and/or entities which are the targets of the sentiment. For instance, when the utterance is, *The breakfast was yummy but the staff is unfriendly*, the targets for the two sentiment expressions are `meal` and `staff`. Named entities may also be targets of the sentiment.
*   `reasons` (array of strings) - when available, provides reasons for the sentiment. In the example utterance above (*The breakfast was yummy but the staff is unfriendly*), the `reasons` array for the `staff` is `["unfriendly"]`, while the `reasons` array for `meal` is `["tasty"]`.
*   `explanation` (string) - when available, provides rationale for the sentiment; set the `explain` setting to `true` to enable.
    

Example:

``` json
"sentiment_expressions": [
        {
            "sentence_index": 0,
             "offset": 0,
             "length": 32,
             "polarity": "positive",
             "reasons": ["close"],
             "targets": ["location"]
         },
         {
            "sentence_index": 0,
             "offset": 38,
             "length": 29,
             "polarity": "negative",
             "reasons": ["disrespectful"],
             "targets": ["staff"]
         }
     ]

```

## Entities

The `entities_summary` section is an array of named entity objects detected in the text.

The section exists if named entities are detected and the `entities` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.

Every entity contains the following attributes:

*   `name` (string) - the most complete name of the entity in the text of all the mentions
*   `ref_lemma` (string) - when available, the dictionary form of the entity in the reference language (English) regardless of the input language
*   `type` (string) - a string or an array of strings specifying the type of the entity, such as `person`, `organization`, `numeric`, `amount_of_money`, `place`. Certain entities, like countries, may have several types (because a country is both a `place` and an `organization`).
*   `subtype` (string) - a string indicating the subtype of the entity
*   `mentions` (array of objects) - a set of instances where the entity was mentioned in the text
    

Every mention contains the following attributes:

*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts
*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the content
*   `sentence_index` (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance
*   `text` (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the `snippets` setting is set to `true`)
    

Example:

``` json
 "entities_summary": [
        {
            "type": "person",
             "name": "John Smith",
             "ref_lemma": "John Smith",
             "mentions": [
                {
                    "sentence_index": 0,
                     "offset": 0,
                     "length": 10 }
             ]
         }
    ,
         {
            "type": [ "organization", "place" ]
        ,
             "name": "UK",
             "ref_lemma": "U.K.",
             "mentions": [
                {
                    "sentence_index": 0,
                     "offset": 40,
                     "length": 2 }
             ]
         }
     ]

```

### Entity Types and Subtypes

The currently supported entity types are:

*   `person`, with optional subtypes: `fictional_character`, `important_person`, `spiritual_being`
*   `organization` (note that a country is both an organization and a place)
*   `place`
*   `time_range`
*   `date`
*   `time`
*   `hashtag`
*   `email`
*   `amount_of_money`
*   `phone` phone number, either domestic or international, in a variety of formats
*   `role` (a social role, e.g. position in an organization)
*   `software`
*   `website` (URL), with an optional subtype: `tor` for Onion links; note that web services may also have the `software` type assigned
*   `weight`
*   `bank_account` only IBAN format is supported; subtypes: `iban`
*   `credit_card`, with optional subtypes: `visa`, `mastercard`, `american_express`, `diners_club`, `discovery`, `jcb`, `unionpay`
*   `coordinates` (GPS coordinates)
*   `credential`, with optional subtypes: `md5`, `sha-1`
*   `crypto`, with optional subtypes: `bitcoin`, `ethereum`, `monero`, `monero_payment_id`, `litecoin`, `dash`
*   `event`
*   `file` only Windows pathnames are supported; subtypes: `windows`, `facebook` (for images downloaded from Facebook)
*   `flight_code`
*   `identifier`
*   `ip_address`, subtypes: `v4`, `v6`
*   `mac_address`
*   `numeric` (an unclassified numeric entity)
*   `username`
    

## Topics

The `topics` section is an array of topics (subjects, domains, themes in other terms) detected in the text.

The section exists if topics are detected and the `topics` [setting](#settings-reference) is either omitted or set to `true`.

By default, a topic is a string. If `topic_stats` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`, then every entry in the array contains:

*   `topic` (string) - the topic itself
*   `coverage` (floating-point number) - a number between 0 and 1, indicating the ratio between the number of sentences where the topic is detected to the total number of sentences
    

## Long-Term Memory

The `memory` section contains optional context to pass to the `settings` in subsequent messages in the same conversation thread. See [Context and Long-Term Memory](#context-and-long-term-memory) for more details.

## Low-Level: Sentences, Phrases, and Words

Tisane allows obtaining more in-depth data, specifically:

*   sentences and their corrected form, if a misspelling was detected
*   lexical chunks and their grammatical and stylistic features
*   parse trees and phrases
    

The `sentence_list` section is generated if the `words` or the `parses` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`.

Every sentence structure in the list contains:

*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the sentence starts
*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the sentence
*   `text` (string) - the sentence itself
*   `corrected_text` (string) - if a misspelling was detected and the spellchecking is active, contains the automatically corrected text
*   `words` (array of structures) - if `words` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`, generates extended information about every lexical chunk. (The term "word" is used for the sake of simplicity, however, it may not be linguistically correct to equate lexical chunks with words.)
*   `parse_tree` (object) - if `parses` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`, generates information about the parse tree and the phrases detected in the sentence.
*   `nbest_parses` (array of parse objects) if `parses` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true` and `deterministic` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `false`, generates information about the parse trees that were deemed close enough to the best one but not the best.
    

### Words

Every lexical chunk ("word") structure in the `words` array contains:

*   `type` (string) - the type of the element: `punctuation` for punctuation marks, `numeral` for numerals, or `word` for everything else
*   `text` (string) - the text
*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the element starts
*   `length` (unsigned integer) - length of the element
*   `corrected_text` (string) - if a misspelling is detected, the corrected form
*   `lettercase` (string) - the original letter case: `upper`, `capitalized`, or `mixed`. If lowercase or no case, the attribute is omitted.
*   `stopword` (boolean) - determines whether the word is a [stopword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)
*   `grammar` (array of strings or structures) - generates the list of grammar features associated with the `word`. If the `feature_standard` setting is defined as `native`, then every feature is an object containing a numeral (`index`) and a string (`value`). Otherwise, every feature is a plain string
    

#### Advanced

For lexical words only:

*   `role` (string) - semantic role, like `agent` or `patient`. Note that in passive voice, the semantic roles are reverse to the syntactic roles. E.g. in a sentence like *The car was driven by David*, *car* is the patient, and *David* is the agent.
*   `numeric_value` (floating-point number) - the numeric value, if the chunk has a value associated with it
*   `family` (integer number) - the ID of the family associated with the disambiguated word-sense of the lexical chunk
*   `definition` (string) - the definition of the family, if the `fetch_definitions` [setting](#settings-reference) is set to `true`
*   `lexeme` (integer number) - the ID of the lexeme entry associated with the disambiguated word-sense of the lexical chunk
*   `nondictionary_pattern` (integer number) - the ID of a non-dictionary pattern that matched, if the word was not in the language model but was classified by the nondictionary heuristics
*   `style` (array of strings or structures) - generates the list of style features associated with the `word`. Only if the `feature_standard` setting is set to `native` or `description`
*   `semantics` (array of strings or structures) - generates the list of semantic features associated with the `word`. Only if the `feature_standard` setting is set to `native` or `description`
*   `segmentation` (structure) - generates info about the selected segmentation, if there are several possibilities to segment the current lexical chunk and the `deterministic` setting is set to `false`. A segmentation is simply an array of `word` structures.
*   `other_segmentations` (array of structures) - generates info about the segmentations deemed incorrect during the disambiguation process. Every entry has the same structure as the `segmentation` structure.
*   `nbest_senses` (array of structures) - when the `deterministic` setting is set to `false`, generates a set of hypotheses that were deemed incorrect by the disambiguation process. Every hypothesis contains the following attributes: `grammar`, `style`, and `semantics`, identical in structure to their counterparts above; and `senses`, an array of word-senses associated with every hypothesis. Every sense has a `family`, which is an ID of the associated family; and, if the `fetch_definitions` setting is set to `true`, `definition` and `ref_lemma` of that family.
    

For punctuation marks only:

*   `id` (integer number) - the ID of the punctuation mark
*   `behavior` (string) - the behavior code of the punctuation mark. Values: `sentenceTerminator`, `genericComma`, `bracketStart`, `bracketEnd`, `scopeDelimiter`, `hyphen`, `quoteStart`, `quoteEnd`, `listComma` (for East-Asian enumeration commas like *、*)
    

### Parse Trees and Phrases

Every parse tree, or more accurately, parse forest, is a collection of phrases, hierarchically linked to each other.

At the top level of the parse, there is an array of root phrases under the `phrases` element and the numeric `id` associated with it. Every phrase may have children phrases. Every phrase has the following attributes:

*   `type` (string) - a [Penn treebank phrase tag](http://nliblog.com/wiki/knowledge-base-2/nlp-1-natural-language-processing/penn-treebank/penn-treebank-phrase-level-tags/) denoting the type of the phrase, e.g. *S*, *VP*, *NP*, etc.
*   `family` (integer number) - an ID of the phrase family
*   `offset` (unsigned integer) - a zero-based offset where the phrase starts
*   `length` (unsigned integer) - the span of the phrase
*   `role` (string) - the semantic role of the phrase, if any, analogous to that of the words
*   `text` (string) - the phrase text, where the phrase members are delimited by the vertical bar character. Children phrases are enclosed in brackets. E.g., *driven\|by\|David* or *(The\|car)\|was\|(driven\|by\|David)*.
    

Example:

``` json
"parse_tree": {
"id": 4,
"phrases": [
{
        "type": "S",
        "family": 1451,
        "offset": 0,
        "length": 27,
        "text": "(The\|car)\|was\|(driven\|by\|David)",
        "children": [
                {
                        "type": "NP",
                        "family": 1081,
                        "offset": 0,
                        "length": 7,
                        "text": "The\|car",
                        "role": "patient"
                },
                {
                        "type": "VP",
                        "family": 1172,
                        "offset": 12,
                        "length": 15,
                        "text": "driven\|by\|David",
                        "role": "verb"
                }
        ]
}

```

### Context-Aware Spelling Correction

Tisane supports automatic, context-aware spelling correction. Whether it's a misspelling or a purported obfuscation, Tisane attempts to deduce the intended meaning, if the language model does not recognize the word.

When or if it's found, Tisane adds the `corrected_text` attribute to the word (if the words / lexical chunks are returned) and the sentence (if the sentence text is generated). Sentence-level `corrected_text` is displayed if `words` or `parses` are set to *true*.

Note that as Tisane works with large dictionaries, you may need to exclude more esoteric terms by using the `min_generic_frequency` setting.

Note that **the invocation of spell-checking does not depend on whether the sentences and the words sections are generated in the output**. The spellchecking can be disabled by setting `disable_spellcheck` to `true`. Another option is to enable the spellchecking for lowercase words only, thus excluding potential proper nouns in languages that support capitalization; to avoid spell-checking capitalized and uppercase words, set `lowercase_spellcheck_only` to `true`.

# Settings Reference

The purpose of the settings structure is to:

*   provide cues about the content being sent to improve the results
*   customize the output and select sections to be shown
*   define standards and formats in use
*   define and calculate the signal to noise ranking
    

All settings are optional. To leave all settings to default, simply provide an empty object (`{}`).

## Content Cues and Instructions

`format` (string) - the format of the content. Some policies will be applied depending on the format. Certain logic in the underlying language models may require the content to be of a certain format (e.g. logic applied on the reviews may seek for sentiment more aggressively). The default format is empty / undefined. The format values are:

*   `review` - a review of a product or a service or any other review. Normally, the underlying language models will seek for sentiment expressions more aggressively in reviews.
*   `dialogue` - a comment or a post which is a part of a dialogue. An example of a logic more specific to a dialogue is name calling. A single word like "idiot" would not be a personal attack in any other format, but it is certainly a personal attack when part of a dialogue.
*   `shortpost` - a microblogging post, e.g. a tweet.
*   `longform` - a long post or an article.
*   `proofread` - a post which was proofread. In the proofread posts, the spellchecking is switched off.
*   `alias` - a nickname in an online community.
*   `search` - a search query. Search queries may not always be grammatically correct. Certain topics and items, that we may otherwise let pass, are tagged with the `search` format.
    

`disable_spellcheck` (boolean) - determines whether the automatic spellchecking is to be disabled. Default: `false`.

`lowercase_spellcheck_only` (boolean) - determines whether the automatic spellchecking is only to be applied to words in lowercase. Default: `false`

`min_generic_frequency` (int) - allows excluding more esoteric terms; the valid values are 0 thru 10.

`subscope` (boolean) - enables sub-scope parsing, for scenarios like hashtag, URL parsing, and obfuscated content (e.g. *ihateyou*). Default: `false`.

`lang_detect_segmentation_regex` (string) - allows defining custom language detection fragment boundaries. For example, if multiple languages may be used in different sentences in the same text, you may want to define the regex as: `(([\r\n]\|[.!?][ ]))` .

`domain_factors` (set of pairs made of strings and numbers) - provides a session-scope cues for the domains of discourse. This is a powerful tool that allows tailoring the result based on the use case. The format is, family ID of the domain as a key and the multiplication factor as a value (e.g. *"12345": 5.0*). For example, when processing text looking for criminal activity, we may want to set domains relevant to drugs, firearms, crime, higher: `"domain_factors": {"31058": 5.0, "45220": 5.0, "14112": 5.0, "14509": 3.0, "28309": 5.0, "43220": 5.0, "34581": 5.0}`. The same device can be used to eliminate noise coming from domains we know are irrelevant by setting the factor to a value lower than 1.

`when` (date string, format YYYY-MM-DD) - indicates when the utterance was uttered. (TO BE IMPLEMENTED) The purpose is to prune word senses that were not available at a particular point in time. For example, the words *troll*, *mail*, and *post* had nothing to do with the Internet 300 years ago because there was no Internet, and so in a text that was written hundreds of years ago, we should ignore the word senses that emerged only recently.

## Output Customization

`abuse` (boolean) - output instances of abusive content (default: `true`)

`sentiment` (boolean) - output sentiment-bearing snippets (default: `true`)

`document_sentiment` (boolean) - output document-level sentiment (default: `false`)

`entities` (boolean) - output entities (default: `true`)

`topics` (boolean) - output topics (default: `true`), with two more relevant settings:

*   `topic_stats` (boolean) - include coverage statistics in the topic output (default: `false`). When set, the topic is an object containing the attributes `topic` (string) and `coverage` (floating-point number). The coverage indicates a share of sentences touching the topic among all the sentences.
*   `optimize_topics` (boolean) - if `true`, the less specific topics are removed if they are parts of the more specific topics. For example, when the topic is `cryptocurrency`, the optimization removes `finance`.
    

`words` (boolean) - output the lexical chunks / words for every sentence (default: `false`). In languages without white spaces (Chinese, Japanese, Thai), the tokens are tokenized words. In languages with compounds (e.g. German, Dutch, Norwegian), the compounds are split.

`fetch_definitions` (boolean) - include definitions of the words in the output (default: `false`). Only relevant when the `words` setting is `true`

`parses` (boolean) - output parse forests of phrases

`deterministic` (boolean) - whether the n-best senses and n-best parses are to be output in addition to the detected sense. If `true`, only the detected sense will be output. Default: `true`

`snippets` (boolean) - include the text snippets in the abuse, sentiment, and entities sections (default: `false`)

`explain` (boolean) - if `true`, a reasoning for the abuse and sentiment snippets is provided when possible (see the `explanation` attribute)

## Standards and Formats

`feature_standard` (string) - determines the standard used to output the features (grammar, style, semantics) in the response object. The standards we support are:

*   `ud`: [Universal Dependencies tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) (default)
*   `penn`: [Penn treebank tags](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)
*   `native`: Tisane native feature codes
*   `description`: Tisane native feature descriptions
    

Only the native Tisane standards (codes and descriptions) support style and semantic features.

`topic_standard` (string) - determines the standard used to output the topics in the response object. The standards we support are:

*   `iptc_code` - IPTC topic taxonomy code
*   `iptc_description` - IPTC topic taxonomy description
*   `iab_code` - IAB topic taxonomy code
*   `iab_description` - IAB topic taxonomy description
*   `native` - Tisane domain description, coming from the family description (default)
    

`sentiment_analysis_type` (string) - the type of the sentiment analysis strategy. The values are:

*   `products_and_services` - most common sentiment analysis of products and services
*   `entity` - sentiment analysis with entities as targets
*   `creative_content_review` - reviews of creative content (RESERVED)
*   `political_essay` - political essays (RESERVED)
    

## Context and Long-Term Memory

Human understanding of language is not a simple "sliding window" with scope limited to a sentence. Language is accompanied by gestures, visuals, and knowledge of the previous communication. Sometimes, code-words may be used to conceal the words' original meaning.

When detecting abuse, a name of an ethnicity or a religious group may be not offensive, but when superimposed over a picture of an ape or a pig, it is meant of offend. When translating from a language without gender distinctions in verbs (like English) to a language with distinctions (like Russian or Hebrew), there is no way to know from an utterance alone if the speaker is female. When a scammer is collecting details piecemeal over a series of utterances, knowledge of previous utterances is needed to take action.

Tisane's Memory module allows pre-initializing the analysis, as well as reassigning meanings, and more. The module is made of three simple components that are flexible enough for a variety of tasks:

### Reassignments

Reassignments define the attributes to set based on other attributes. This allows to:

*   assign gender to 1st or 2nd person verbs, generating accurate translations
*   overwrite original meaning of a group of words with all their inflected forms to analyze code-words and secret language
*   add an additional feature or a hypernym to a family
    

and more, within a scope of a call.

The `assign` section is an array of structures defining:

*   `if` - conditions to match:
    *   `regex` - a regular expression (RE2 syntax)
    *   `family` - a family ID
    *   `features` - a list of feature values. A feature is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{"index":1, "value":"NOUN"}`.
    *   `hypernym` - a family ID of a hypernym
*   `then` - attributes to assign
    *   `family` - a family ID
    *   `features` - a list of feature values. A feature is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{"index":1, "value":"NOUN"}`.
    *   `hypernym` - a family ID of a hypernym

Examples:

*   the speaker is female: \`"assign":\[{"if":{"features":\[{"index":9,"value":"1"}\]},"then":{"features":\[{"index":5,"value":"F"}\]}}\]
*   assume that a mention of a container refers to an illegal item: \`"assign":\[{"if":{"family":26888},"then":{"hypernym":123078}}\]
    

### Flags

An array of flag structures that add some context. A flag is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{"index":36, "value":"WFH"}`.

Aside from the flags returned in the `memory` section of the response, these flags can be set:

*   `{"index":36, "value":"PEBD"}` (agents_of_bad_things) - the context is about a bad player or an agent responsible for bad things
*   `{"index":36, "value":"BADANML"}` (bad_animal) - the context is an animal that symbolizes bad qualities (e.g. pig, ape, snake, etc.)
*   `{"index":36, "value":"BULKMSG"}` (bulk_message) - the message was sent in bulk
*   `{"index":36, "value":"DETHR"}` (death_related) - the context is something related to death
*   `{"index":36, "value":"EARNMUCH"}` (make_money) - the context is related to making money
*   `{"index":36, "value":"IDEP"}` (my_departure) - the author of the text mentioned departing
*   `{"index":36, "value":"SECO"}` (sexually_conservative) - any attempt to exchange photos or anything that may be either sexual or non-sexual is to be deemed sexual
*   `{"index":36, "value":"TRPA"}` (trusted_party) - the author of the text claims to be a trusted party (e.g. a relative or a spouse)
*   `{"index":36, "value":"WSTE"}` (waste) - the context is about waste, organic or inorganic
*   `{"index":36, "value":"WOPR"}` (won_prize) - prize or money winning was mentioned or implied
*   `{"index":36, "value":"WFH"}` (work_from_home) - work from home was mentioned
*   `{"index":5, "value":"ORG"}` (organization) - an organization was mentioned
*   `{"index":5, "value":"ROLE"}` (role) - a role or a position was mentioned
    

### Antecedents

The section contains structures to be used in coreference resolution. The attributes are:

*   `family` - the family ID of the antecedent
*   `features` - the list of features. Every feature is a structure with an `index` and a `value`. For example: `{"index":36, "value":"WFH"}`.
    

## Signal to Noise Ranking

When we're studying a bunch of posts commenting on an issue or an article, we may want to prioritize the ones more relevant to the topic, and containing more reason and logic than emotion. This is what the signal to noise ranking is meant to achieve.

The signal to noise ranking is made of two parts:

1.  Determine the most relevant concepts. This part may be omitted, depending on the use case scenario (e.g. we want to track posts most relevant to a particular set of issues).
2.  Rank the actual post in relevance to these concepts.
    

To determine the most relevant concepts, we need to analyze the headline or the article itself. The headline is usually enough. We need two additional settings:

*   `keyword_features` (an object of strings with string values) - determines the features to look for in a word. When such a feature is found, the family ID is added to the set of potentially relevant family IDs.
*   `stop_hypernyms` (an array of integers) - if a potentially relevant family ID has a hypernym listed in this setting, it will not be considered. For example, we extracted a set of nouns from the headline, but we may not be interested in abstractions or feelings. E.g. from a headline like *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* we want *Las Vegas* only. Optional.
    

If `keyword_features` is provided in the settings, the response will have a special attribute, `relevant`, containing a set of family IDs.

At the second stage, when ranking the actual posts or comments for relevance, this array is to be supplied among the settings. The ranking is boosted when the domain, the hypernyms, or the families related to those in the `relevant` array are mentioned, when negative and positive sentiment is linked to aspects, and penalized when the negativity is not linked to aspects, or abuse of any kind is found. The latter consideration may be disabled, e.g. when we are looking for specific criminal content. When the `abuse_not_noise` parameter is specified and set to `true`, the abuse is not penalized by the ranking calculations.

To sum it up, in order to calculate the signal to noise ranking:

1.  Analyze the headline with `keyword_features` and, optionally, `stop_hypernyms` in the settings. Obtain the `relevant` attribute.
2.  When analyzing the posts or the comments, specify the `relevant` attribute obtained in step 1. | No | Yes | Unknown |

| [Velo Payments APIs](https://velopayments.com) | ## Terms and Definitions

Throughout this document and the Velo platform the following terms are used:

* **Payor.** An entity (typically a corporation) which wishes to pay funds to one or more payees via a payout.
* **Payee.** The recipient of funds paid out by a payor.
* **Payment.** A single transfer of funds from a payor to a payee.
* **Payout.** A batch of Payments, typically used by a payor to logically group payments (e.g. by business day). Technically there need be no relationship between the payments in a payout - a single payout can contain payments to multiple payees and/or multiple payments to a single payee.
* **Sandbox.** An integration environment provided by Velo Payments which offers a similar API experience to the production environment, but all funding and payment events are simulated, along with many other services such as OFAC sanctions list checking.

## Overview

The Velo Payments API allows a payor to perform a number of operations. The following is a list of the main capabilities in a natural order of execution:

* Authenticate with the Velo platform
* Maintain a collection of payees
* Query the payor’s current balance of funds within the platform and perform additional funding
* Issue payments to payees
* Query the platform for a history of those payments

This document describes the main concepts and APIs required to get up and running with the Velo Payments platform. It is not an exhaustive API reference. For that, please see the separate Velo Payments API Reference.

## API Considerations

The Velo Payments API is REST based and uses the JSON format for requests and responses.

Most calls are secured using OAuth 2 security and require a valid authentication access token for successful operation. See the Authentication section for details.

Where a dynamic value is required in the examples below, the {token} format is used, suggesting that the caller needs to supply the appropriate value of the token in question (without including the { or } characters).

Where curl examples are given, the –d @filename.json approach is used, indicating that the request body should be placed into a file named filename.json in the current directory. Each of the curl examples in this document should be considered a single line on the command-line, regardless of how they appear in print.

## Authenticating with the Velo Platform

Once Velo backoffice staff have added your organization as a payor within the Velo platform sandbox, they will create you a payor Id, an API key and an API secret and share these with you in a secure manner.

You will need to use these values to authenticate with the Velo platform in order to gain access to the APIs. The steps to take are explained in the following:

create a string comprising the API key (e.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8) and API secret (e.g. c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529) with a colon between them. E.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8:c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529

base64 encode this string. E.g.: NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==

create an HTTP **Authorization** header with the value set to e.g. Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==

perform the Velo authentication REST call using the HTTP header created above e.g. via curl:

```
  curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==" \
  'https://api.sandbox.velopayments.com/v1/authenticate?grant_type=client_credentials'
```

If successful, this call will result in a **200** HTTP status code and a response body such as:

```
  {
    "access_token":"19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f",
    "token_type":"bearer",
    "expires_in":1799,
    "scope":"..."
  }
```
## API access following authentication
Following successful authentication, the value of the access_token field in the response (indicated in green above) should then be presented with all subsequent API calls to allow the Velo platform to validate that the caller is authenticated.

This is achieved by setting the HTTP Authorization header with the value set to e.g. Bearer 19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f such as the curl example below:

```
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f "
```

If you make other Velo API calls which require authorization but the Authorization header is missing or invalid then you will get a **401** HTTP status response. | `OAuth` | Yes | Unknown |

\|-------------------------\|-------------------------\|
\|US Production \| https://rest.zuora.com   \|
\|US API Sandbox    \| https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com\|
\|US Performance Test \| https://rest.pt1.zuora.com \|
\|US Production Copy \| Submit a request at <a href="http://support.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611) for more information. \|
\|US Cloud Production \| 	https://rest.na.zuora.com \|
\|US Cloud API Sandbox \| 	https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com \|
\|US Central Sandbox \| 	https://rest.test.zuora.com \|    
\|EU Production \| https://rest.eu.zuora.com \|
\|EU API Sandbox \| https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com \|
\|EU Central Sandbox \| 	https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com \|

The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.


If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href="https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive" target="_blank">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.

# Authentication

## OAuth v2.0

Zuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments) for more information.

Zuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for how to do this. By creating a dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users.

If a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.

Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
1. Create a Client
2. Generate a Token
3. Make Authenticated Requests

### Create a Client

You must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.

**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the "API Write Access" permission.

### Generate a Token

After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:
- `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`

**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. You should reuse the bearer token until it is expired. When the token is expired, call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new one.

### Make Authenticated Requests

To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities) enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.

If the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following headers:
- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`
- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`

**Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all "-" characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.

If the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.

## Other Supported Authentication Schemes

Zuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:

  * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: 
  
    * `apiAccessKeyId` 
    * `apiSecretAccessKey`
    
    Zuora recommends that you create an API user specifically for making API calls. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for more information.
  
  * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections) resource with the following API user information: 
  
    *   ID    
    *   Password
    
  * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.

### Entity Id and Entity Name

The `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity "Zuora Multi-entity"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` parameter instead.


The  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name "Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy") that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. 

You can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.

  * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. 
  * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. 
  

To get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication "API User Authentication").
  
  ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs
  
  The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.
  
For security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for authentication.

The token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.

See [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/C_REST_API/Zuora_CORS_REST "Zuora CORS REST") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature "HMAC Signatures") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.

# Requests and Responses

## Request IDs 
As a general rule, when asked to supply a "key" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.

## HTTP Request Body

Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. 

The Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.

### Data Type

([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.

## Testing a Request

Use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se "curl"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com "Postman"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com "Advanced REST Client"), to test the Zuora REST API.

You can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.

## Testing with Credit Cards

Sooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards "C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards"
).

## Concurrent Request Limits

Zuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits" target="_blank">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.

## Timeout Limit

If a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and Zuora returns a Gateway Timeout error.


# Error Handling

If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1` (except [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.

The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:

```
 {
   "success": false,
   "processId": "CBCFED6580B4E076",
   "reasons":  [
     {
      "code": 53100320,
      "message": "'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN"
     }
    ]
 }
```
The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.

The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.

The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011` indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. 

When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:

<a href="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg" alt="Zuora Error Code Sample"></a>


**Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field. 
The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the [Error Category Code](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Code) section. 
In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.


## REST API Resource Code

The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. 

The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to `679999`. See [Resource Codes](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes) in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.

## Error Category Code

The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field. 

The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:

\| Code    \| Error category              \| Description    \| Resolution    \|
\|:--------\|:--------\|:--------\|:--------\|
\| 10      \| Permission or access denied \| The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. \| Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) for enablement. \|
\| 11      \| Authentication failed       \| Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. \| Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. \|
\| 20      \| Invalid format or value     \| The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. \| Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. \|
\| 21      \| Unknown field in request    \| The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. \| Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. \|
\| 22      \| Missing required field      \| The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. \| Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. \|
\| 30      \| Rule restriction            \| The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. \| Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. \|
\| 40      \| Not found                   \| The specified resource cannot be found. \| Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. \|
\| 45      \| Unsupported request         \| The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. \| Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. \|
\| 50      \| Locking contention          \| This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. \| <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> \|
\| 60      \| Internal error              \| The server encounters an internal error. \| Contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. \|
\| 70      \| Request exceeded limit      \| The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. \| <p>Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits) for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> \|
\| 90      \| Malformed request           \| The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. \| Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. \|
\| 99      \| Integration error           \| The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. \| Check the response message and take action accordingly. \|


# Pagination

When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.

The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.

If more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No "previous page" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.

## Array Size

For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.

# API Versions

The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.

## Major Version

The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.

## Minor Version

Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. 

Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. 

If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.

If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.

You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.

For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 

### Minor Version History

The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.

The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.

## API Names

You can use the [Describe object](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_Describe) operation to list the fields of each Zuora object that is available in your tenant. When you call the operation, you must specify the API name of the Zuora object.

The following table provides the API name of each Zuora object:

For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications). | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Adyen Hosted onboarding API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/) | This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.

The Hosted onboarding API provides endpoints that you can use to generate links to Adyen-hosted pages, such as an [onboarding page](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/hosted-onboarding-page) or a [PCI compliance questionnaire](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/platforms-for-partners). You can provide these links to your account holders so that they can complete their onboarding.

## Authentication
Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

 ```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
...
```

Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

```
curl
-U "ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
...
```
When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

## Versioning
The Hosted onboarding API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v6/getOnboardingUrl

| [Apacta](https://apacta.com) | API for a tool to craftsmen used to register working hours, material usage and quality assurance.
# Endpoint
The endpoint `https://app.apacta.com/api/v1` should be used to communicate with the API. API access is only allowed with SSL encrypted connection (https).
# Authentication
URL query authentication with an API key is used, so appending `?api_key={api_key}` to the URL where `{api_key}` is found within Apacta settings is used for authentication
# Pagination
If the endpoint returns a `pagination` object it means the endpoint supports pagination - currently it's only possible to change pages with `?page={page_number}` but implementing custom page sizes are on the road map.


# Search/filter
Is experimental but implemented in some cases - see the individual endpoints' docs for further explanation.
# Ordering
Is currently experimental, but on some endpoints it's implemented on URL querys so eg. to order Invoices by `invoice_number` appending `?sort=Invoices.invoice_number&direction=desc` would sort the list descending by the value of `invoice_number`.
# Associations
Is currently implemented on an experimental basis where you can append eg. `?include=Contacts,Projects`  to the `/api/v1/invoices/` endpoint to embed `Contact` and `Project` objects directly.
# Project Files
Currently project files can be retrieved from two endpoints. `/projects/{project_id}/files` handles files uploaded from wall posts or forms. `/projects/{project_id}/project_files` allows uploading and showing files, not belonging to specific form or wall post.
# Errors/Exceptions
## 422 (Validation)
Write something about how the `errors` object contains keys with the properties that failes validation like:
```
  {
      "success": false,
      "data": {
          "code": 422,
          "url": "/api/v1/contacts?api_key=5523be3b-30ef-425d-8203-04df7caaa93a",
          "message": "A validation error occurred",
          "errorCount": 1,
          "errors": {
              "contact_types": [ ## Property name that failed validation
                  "Contacts must have at least one contact type" ## Message with further explanation
              ]
          }
      }
  }

| [Apideck Vault API](https://developers.apideck.com) | Welcome to the Vault API 👋

When you're looking to connect to an API, the first step is authentication.

Vault helps you handle OAuth flows, store API keys, and refresh access tokens from users (called consumers in Apideck).

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`

## Get Started

To use the Apideck APIs, you need to sign up for free at [https://app.apideck.com/signup](). Follow the steps below to get started.

- [Create a free account.](https://app.apideck.com/signup)
- Go to the [Dashboard](https://app.apideck.com/unify/unified-apis/dashboard).
- Get your API key and the application ID.
- Select and configure the integrations you want to make available to your users. Through the Unify dashboard, you can configure which connectors you want to support as integrations.
- Retrieve the client_id and client_secret for the integration you want to activate (Only needed for OAuth integrations).
- Soon, you can skip the previous step and use the Apideck sandbox credentials to get you started instead (upcoming)
- Register the redirect URI for the example app (https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback) in the list of redirect URIs under your app's settings
- Use the [publishing guides](/app-listing-requirements) to get your integration listed across app marketplaces.

### Hosted Vault

Hosted Vault (vault.apideck.com) is a no-code solution, so you don't need to build your own UI to handle the integration settings and authentication.

![Hosted Vault - Integrations portal](https://github.com/apideck-samples/integration-settings/raw/master/public/img/vault.png)

Behind the scenes, Hosted Vault implements the Vault API endpoints and handles the following features for your customers:

- Add a connection
- Handle the OAuth flow
- Configure connection settings per integration
- Manage connections
- Discover and propose integration options
- Search for integrations (upcoming)
- Give integration suggestions based on provided metadata (email or website) when creating the session (upcoming)

To use Hosted Vault, you will need to first [**create a session**](https://developers.apideck.com/apis/vault/reference#operation/sessionsCreate). This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Vault API to create a valid session for a user, hereafter referred to as the consumer ID.

Example using curl:

```
curl -X POST https://unify.apideck.com/vault/sessions
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>"
    -H "X-APIDECK-CONSUMER-ID: <consumer-id>"
    -H "X-APIDECK-APP-ID: <application-id>"
    -d '{"consumer_metadata": { "account_name" : "Sample", "user_name": "Sand Box", "email": "sand@box.com", "image": "https://unavatar.now.sh/jake" }, "theme": { "vault_name": "Intercom", "primary_color": "#286efa", "sidepanel_background_color": "#286efa","sidepanel_text_color": "#FFFFFF", "favicon": "https://res.cloudinary.com/apideck/icons/intercom" }}'
```

### Vault API

_Beware, this is strategy takes more time to implement in comparison to Hosted Vault._

If you are building your integration settings UI manually, you can call the Vault API directly.

The Vault API is for those who want to completely white label the in-app integrations overview and authentication experience. All the available endpoints are listed below.

Through the API, your customers authenticate directly in your app, where Vault will still take care of redirecting to the auth provider and back to your app.

If you're already storing access tokens, we will help you migrate through our Vault Migration API (upcoming).

## Domain model

At its core, a domain model creates a web of interconnected entities.

Our domain model contains five main entity types: Consumer (user, account, team, machine), Application, Connector, Integration, and Connection.

## Connection state

The connection state is computed based on the connection flow below.

![](https://developers.apideck.com/api-references/vault/connection-flow.png)

## Unify and Proxy integration

The only thing you need to use the Unify APIs and Proxy is the consumer id; thereafter, Vault will do the look-up in the background to handle the token injection before performing the API call(s).

## Headers

Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

\| Name                  \| Type    \| Required \| Description \|
\| --------------------- \| ------- \| -------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|
\| x-apideck-app-id      \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/api-keys. \|
\| x-apideck-consumer-id \| String  \| Yes      \| The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. \|
\| x-apideck-raw         \| Boolean \| No       \| Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes. \|

## Sandbox (upcoming)

The sandbox is pre-loaded with data similar to a real-life integrations setup. You can use the preconfigured OAauth configured connectors for testing purposes and can skip this step by using the Apideck sandbox credentials to get you started.

## FAQ

**What purpose does Vault serve? Can I just handle the authentication and access token myself?**
You can store everything yourself, but that defeats the purpose of using Apideck Unify. Handling tokens for multiple providers can quickly become very complex.

### Is my data secure?

Vault employs data minimization, therefore only requesting the minimum amount of scopes needed to perform an API request.

### How do I migrate existing data?

Using our migration API, you can migrate the access tokens and accounts to Apideck Vault. (COMING SOON)

### Can I use Vault in combination with existing integrations?

Yes, you can. The flexibility of Unify allows you to quickly the use cases you need while keeping a gradual migration path based on your timeline and requirements.

### How does Vault work for Apideck Ecosystem customers?

Once logged in, pick your ecosystem; on the left-hand side of the screen, you'll have the option to create an application underneath the Unify section.

### How to integrate Apideck Vault

This section covers everything you need to know to authenticate your customers through Vault.
Vault provides **three auth strategies** to use API tokens from your customers:

- Vault API
- Hosted Vault
- Apideck Ecosystem _(COMING SOON)_

You can also opt to bypass Vault and still take care of authentication flows yourself. Make sure to put the right safeguards in place to protect your customers' tokens and other sensitive data.

### What auth types does Vault support?

What auth strategies does Vault handle? We currently support three flows so your customers can activate an integration.

#### API keys

For Services supporting the API key strategy, you can use Hosted Vault will need to provide an in-app form where users can configure their API keys provided by the integration service.

#### OAuth 2.0

##### Authorization Code Grant Type Flow

Vault handles the complete Authorization Code Grant Type Flow for you. This flow only supports browser-based (passive) authentication because most identity providers don't allow entering a username and password to be entered into applications that they don't own.

Certain connectors require an OAuth redirect authentication flow, where the end-user is redirected to the provider's website or mobile app to authenticate.

This is being handled by the `/authorize` endpoint.

#### Basic auth

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The required fields to complete basic auth are handled by Hosted Vault or by updating the connection through the Vault API below. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [AWS CodeArtifact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p> CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client. </p> <p> <b>CodeArtifact Components</b> </p> <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Repository</b>: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version">package versions</a>, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI, the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), Python CLIs (<b> <code>pip</code> </b> and <code>twine</code>), and NuGet CLIs (<code>nuget</code> and <code>dotnet</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key Management Service (KMS).</p> <p>Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain.</p> <p>The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages.</p> <p>Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html">npm</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html">PyPI</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven">Maven</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-nuget">NuGet</a> package formats.</p> <p>In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a popular npm package)</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional namespace (for example, <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A set of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>, <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p> Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package version</b>: A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning specification</a>. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.</p> </li> </ul> <p>CodeArtifact supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external connection to a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CopyPackageVersions</code>: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateDomain</code>: Creates a domain</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateRepository</code>: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteDomain</code>: Deletes a domain.

| [ClickSend REST API v3](https://clicksend.com) | This is the official API documentation for ClickSend.com

Below you will find a current list of the available methods for clicksend.

**NOTE**: You will need to create a free account to use the API.

You can
[**Register Here**](https://dashboard.clicksend.com/#/signup/step1/).

# API URL

The API should always be accessed over SSL.

Base URL: `https://rest.clicksend.com/v3/`

# Authentication

Basic HTTP authentication should be used in the header.

**Either:**

`username`: Your API username

`password`: Your API key

```
You can get your API credentials by clicking 'API Credentials' on the top right of the dashboard.
```

**OR**

`username`: Your account username

`password`: Your account password

```
These are the same credentials that you use to login to the dashboard.
```

### Authorization Header

The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
1. Username and password are combined into a string `username:password`
1. The resulting string is then encoded using Base64 encoding
1. The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.

For example, if the user uses `Aladdin` as the username and `open sesame` as the password then the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`

### PHP Authentication Header Example (using cURL)

`curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Authorization: Basic ' . base64_encode("$username:$password")]);`

# Searching and Sorting

Most GET endpoints allow searching and sorting. Searches are **not** case-sensitive.

## Search

To perform a search, add `q` as a query parameter. For example:

`/subaccounts?q=field:value,field2:value`

## Order

To perform a sort, add `order_by` as a query parameter. For example:

`/subaccounts?order_by=field:desc/asc`

## AND / OR

By default, it will search using the `AND` operator. This can be set using `operator` as a query parameter. For example:

`/subaccounts?q=field:value&operator=OR`

**Options:**

- `AN` - returns results matching **all** query fields specified

- `OR` - returns results matching **any** query fields specified

## Example

`/subaccounts?q=first_name:john,last_name:smith&order_by=subaccount_id:asc&operator=AND`

# CORS

When creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.

# Date and Time

All date/timestamps will be returned in Unix time (also known as POSIX time or erroneously as Epoch time) with no leap seconds.

For example: `1435255816`

```
(ISO 8601: 2015-06-25T18:10:16Z)
```

More information: [Wikipedia: Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

There is ony one Unix time and it is created by using the UTC/GMT time zone. This means you might have convert time zones to calculate timestamps. Most programming language have libraries to help you converting time zones.

**The current Unix time can be found here:** [Epoch Converter](http://www.epochconverter.com)

| [Cpy PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org) | The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite
HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. The spec API is fully compatible with
[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO)
which generates a client SDK in the language of your choice - we generate some client SDKs automatically:

- [Python](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/python)
- [Go](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/go)
- [Kotlin](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/kotlin)

See the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few
examples of using the PeerTube API.

# Authentication

When you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility
to generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one
access token can currently be used at a time__.

## Roles

Accounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on
PeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.

# Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
of the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.

```
HTTP 1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "detail": "Video not found",
  "docs": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo",
  "status": 404,
  "title": "Not Found",
  "type": "about:blank"
}
```

We provide error `type` values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/shared/models/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),
but it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code
and are non-obvious:

```
HTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "detail": "Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints",
  "docs": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo",
  "status": 403,
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "type": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints"
}
```

Here a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.

### Validation errors

Each parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator
proceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation
errors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:

```
HTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "detail": "Incorrect request parameters: id",
  "docs": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo",
  "instance": "/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180",
  "invalid-params": {
    "id": {
      "location": "params",
      "msg": "Invalid value",
      "param": "id",
      "value": "9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180"
    }
  },
  "status": 400,
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "type": "about:blank"
}
```

Where `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.
`invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and
`invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`
is about.

### Deprecated error fields

Some fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:
- `error`: superseded by `detail`
- `code`: superseded by `type` (which is now an URI)

# Rate limits

We are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:

\| Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) \| Calls         \| Time frame   \|
\|------------------------------\|---------------\|--------------\|
\| `/*`                         \| 50            \| 10 seconds   \|
\| `POST /users/token`          \| 15            \| 5 minutes    \|
\| `POST /users/register`       \| 2<sup>*</sup> \| 5 minutes    \|
\| `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` \| 3      \| 5 minutes    \|

Depending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service
limit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

You can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the
following headers:

\| Header                  \| Description                                                \|
\|-------------------------\|------------------------------------------------------------\|
\| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     \| Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  \|
\| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` \| Number of remaining requests in the current time period    \|
\| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     \| Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  \|
\| `Retry-After`           \| Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         \|

# CORS

This API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),
allowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:

\| Endpoint                    \|
\|------------------------- ---\|
\| `/api/*`                    \|
\| `/download/*`               \|
\| `/lazy-static/*`            \|
\| `/.well-known/webfinger`    \|

| [DigitalOcean API](https://digitalocean.com) | # Introduction

The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the
DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.

All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean
control panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the
complex actions that your situation requires.

The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design
and technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information
about specific endpoints.

## Requests

Any tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by
requesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol
so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods
depending on the action required.

\|Method\|Usage\|
\|--- \|--- \|
\|GET\|For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method.  The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests.  Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.\|
\|DELETE\|To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and environment, the DELETE method should be used.  This will remove the specified object if it is found.  If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its existence.\|
\|PUT\|To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent.  It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.\|
\|PATCH\|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.\|
\|POST\|To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object.  When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.\|
\|HEAD\|Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD method to get the headers.  This returns only the header of what would be returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some useful information about your API access and the results that are available for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination information, and the total content length.\|


## HTTP Statuses

Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return
standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.

In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the
body of the response will usually contain additional information about the
problem that was encountered.

In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that
the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.

Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue
with the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you
did not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you
do not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not
exist, or that your request is malformed.

If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a
server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and
cannot fulfill your request currently.

400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body,
including the following attributes:

\|Name\|Type\|Description\|
\|--- \|--- \|--- \|
\|id\|string\|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be "not_found."\|
\|message\|string\|A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.\|
\|request_id\|string\|Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.\|

### Example Error Response

```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    {
      "id":       "forbidden",
      "message":  "You do not have access for the attempted action."
    }
```

## Responses

When a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in
the form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is
processed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty
response body.

Inside of this JSON object, the resource root that was the target of the
request will be set as the key. This will be the singular form of the word
if the request operated on a single object, and the plural form of the word
if a collection was processed.

For example, if you send a GET request to `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID` you
will get back an object with a key called "`droplet`". However, if you send
the GET request to the general collection at `/v2/droplets`, you will get
back an object with a key called "`droplets`".

The value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a
single object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of
objects.

### Response for a Single Object

```
    {
        "droplet": {
            "name": "example.com"
            . . .
        }
    }
```

### Response for an Object Collection

```
    {
        "droplets": [
            {
                "name": "example.com"
                . . .
            },
            {
                "name": "second.com"
                . . .
            }
        ]
    }
```

## Meta

In addition to the main resource root, the response may also contain a
`meta` object. This object contains information about the response itself.

The `meta` object contains a `total` key that is set to the total number of
objects returned by the request. This has implications on the `links` object
and pagination.

The `meta` object will only be displayed when it has a value. Currently, the
`meta` object will have a value when a request is made on a collection (like
`droplets` or `domains`).


### Sample Meta Object

```
    {
        . . .
        "meta": {
            "total": 43
        }
        . . .
    }
```

## Links & Pagination

The `links` object is returned as part of the response body when pagination
is enabled. By default, 20 objects are returned per page. If the response
contains 20 objects or fewer, no `links` object will be returned. If the
response contains more than 20 objects, the first 20 will be returned along
with the `links` object.

You can request a different pagination limit or force pagination by
appending `?per_page=` to the request with the number of items you would
like per page. For instance, to show only two results per page, you could
add `?per_page=2` to the end of your query. The maximum number of results
per page is 200.

The `links` object contains a `pages` object. The `pages` object, in turn,
contains keys indicating the relationship of additional pages. The values of
these are the URLs of the associated pages. The keys will be one of the
following:

*   **first**: The URI of the first page of results.
*   **prev**: The URI of the previous sequential page of results.
*   **next**: The URI of the next sequential page of results.
*   **last**: The URI of the last page of results.

The `pages` object will only include the links that make sense. So for the
first page of results, no `first` or `prev` links will ever be set. This
convention holds true in other situations where a link would not make sense.

### Sample Links Object

```
    {
        . . .
        "links": {
            "pages": {
                "last": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2",
                "next": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2"
            }
        }
        . . .
    }
```

## Rate Limit

Requests through the API are rate limited per OAuth token. Current rate limits:

*   5,000 requests per hour
*   250 requests per minute (5% of the hourly total)

Once you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle
starts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for
the best results.

The rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of
each request. The relevant headers are:

*   **ratelimit-limit**: The number of requests that can be made per hour.
*   **ratelimit-remaining**: The number of requests that remain before you hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits expire.
*   **ratelimit-reset**: This represents the time when the oldest request will expire. The value is given in [Unix epoch time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). See below for more information about how request limits expire.

As long as the `ratelimit-remaining` count is above zero, you will be able
to make additional requests.

The way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count
is important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for an
hour and resetting the `ratelimit-remaining` value at the end of the hour,
each request instead has its own timer.

This means that each request contributes toward the `ratelimit-remaining`
count for one complete hour after the request is made. When that request's
timer runs out, it is no longer counted towards the request limit.

This has implications on the meaning of the `ratelimit-reset` header as
well. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of
this header is set to the time when the _oldest_ request will expire.

Keep this in mind if you see your `ratelimit-reset` value change, but not
move an entire hour into the future.

If the `ratelimit-remaining` reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive
a 429 error code until the request reset has been reached. You can see the
format of the response in the examples.

**Note:** The following endpoints have special rate limit requirements that
are independent of the limits defined above.

*   Only 12 `POST` requests to the `/v2/floating_ips` endpoint to create Floating IPs can be made per 60 seconds.
*   Only 10 `GET` requests to the `/v2/account/keys` endpoint to list SSH keys can be made per 60 seconds.
*   Only 5 requests to any and all `v2/cdn/endpoints` can be made per 10 seconds. This includes `v2/cdn/endpoints`, 
    `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID`, and `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`.
*   Only 50 strings within the `files` json struct in the `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache` [payload](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#operation/cdn_purge_cache) 
    can be requested every 20 seconds.

### Sample Rate Limit Headers

```
    . . .
    ratelimit-limit: 1200
    ratelimit-remaining: 1193
    rateLimit-reset: 1402425459
    . . .
```

### Sample Rate Exceeded Response

```
    429 Too Many Requests
    {
            id: "too_many_requests",
            message: "API Rate limit exceeded."
    }
```

## Curl Examples

Throughout this document, some example API requests will be given using the
`curl` command. This will allow us to demonstrate the various endpoints in a
simple, textual format.
  
  These examples assume that you are using a Linux or macOS command line. To run
these commands on a Windows machine, you can either use cmd.exe, PowerShell, or WSL:

* For cmd.exe, use the `set VAR=VALUE` [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1)
to define environment variables, call them with `%VAR%`, then replace all backslashes (`\`) in the examples with carets (`^`).

* For PowerShell, use the `$Env:VAR = "VALUE"` [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.2)
to define environment variables, call them with `$Env:VAR`, then replace `curl` with `curl.exe` and all backslashes (`\`) in the examples with backticks (`` ` ``).

* WSL is a compatibility layer that allows you to emulate a Linux terminal on a Windows machine.
Install WSL with our [community tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10), 
then follow this API documentation normally.

The names of account-specific references (like Droplet IDs, for instance)
will be represented by variables. For instance, a Droplet ID may be
represented by a variable called `$DROPLET_ID`. You can set the associated
variables in your environment if you wish to use the examples without
modification.

The first variable that you should set to get started is your OAuth
authorization token. The next section will go over the details of this, but
you can set an environmental variable for it now.

Generate a token by going to the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)
section of the DigitalOcean control panel. Use an existing token if you have
saved one, or generate a new token with the "Generate new token" button.
Copy the generated token and use it to set and export the TOKEN variable in
your environment as the example shows.

You may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For
example, you may wish to set the `DROPLET_ID` variable to one of your
Droplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.

If you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control
so that your commands will execute correctly.

If you need access to the headers of a response through `curl`, you can pass
the `-i` flag to display the header information along with the body. If you
are only interested in the header, you can instead pass the `-I` flag, which
will exclude the response body entirely.


### Set and Export your OAuth Token

```
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### Set and Export a Variable

```
export DROPLET_ID=1111111
```

## Parameters

There are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.

When passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be
passed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and
values as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that
you are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the
`Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This ensures that your request
is interpreted correctly.

When passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can
be passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters
would be embedded into the URI itself by appending a `?` to the end of the
URI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be
separated with a `&`. Tools like `curl` can create the appropriate URI when
given parameters and values; this can also be done using the `-F` flag and
then passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the
form of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an
equal sign.

### Pass Parameters as a JSON Object

```
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"name": "example.com", "ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}' \
        -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains"
```

### Pass Filter Parameters as a Query String

```
     curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
         -X GET \
         "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?private=true"
```

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.

CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain
that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects
like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can
send requests to an outside domain.

The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions
(other than GET requests) begins by sending a "preflight" request. This sets
the `Origin` header and uses the `OPTIONS` method. The server will reply
back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The
client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed
constraints.

This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can
use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers
that will be set to show the constraints are:

*   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an `Origin` header.
*   **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.
*   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.
*   **Access-Control-Max-Age**: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.
*   **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: This will be set to `true`. It basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.

You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,
because the browser will typically do all of the work for you. | `Bearer` | Yes | Unknown |

# Versioning

The Fulfillment.com (FDC) REST API is version controlled and backwards compatible. We have many future APIs scheduled for publication within our v2.0 spec so please be prepared for us to add data nodes in our responses, however, we will not remove knowledge from previously published APIs.

#### A Current Response

```javascript
{
  id: 123
}
```

#### A Potential Future Response

```javascript
{
  id: 123,
  reason: "More Knowledge"
}
```

# Getting Started

We use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate clients, you can choose [implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) or [password](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/) grant type. To obtain an OAuth `client_id` and `client_secret` contact your account executive.

**Tip**: Generate an additional login and use those credentials for your integration so that changes are accredited to that "user".

You are now ready to make requests to our other APIs by filling your `Authorization` header with `Bearer {access_token}`.

## Perpetuating Access

Perpetuating access to FDC without storing your password locally can be achieved using the `refresh_token` returned by [POST /oauth/access_token](#operation/generateToken).

A simple concept to achieve this is outlined below.

1. Your application/script will ask you for your `username` and `password`, your `client_id` and `client_secret` will be accessible via a DB or ENV.
2. [Request an access_token](#operation/generateToken)
  + Your function should be capable of formatting your request for both a `grant_type` of \"password\" (step 1) and \"refresh_token\" (step 4).
3. Store the `access_token` and `refresh_token` so future requests can skip step 1
4. When the `access_token` expires request anew using your `refresh_token`, replace both tokens in local storage.

+ If this fails you will have to revert to step 1.

Alternatively if you choose for your application/script to have access to your `username` and `password` you can skip step 4.

In all scenarios we recommend storing all credentials outside your codebase.

## Date Time Definitions

We will report all date-time stamps using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard. When using listing API's where fromDate and toDate are available note that both dates are inclusive while requiring the fromDate to be before or at the toDate.

### The Fulfillment Process

Many steps are required to fulfill your order we report back to you three fundamental milestones inside the orders model.

* `recordedOn` When we received your order. This will never change.

* `dispatchDate` When the current iteration of your order was scheduled for fulfillment. This may change however it is an indicator that the physical process of fulfillment has begun and a tracking number has been **assigned** to your order. The tracking number **MAY CHANGE**. You will not be able to cancel an order once it has been dispatched. If you need to recall an order that has been dispatched please contact your account executive.

* `departDate` When we recorded your order passing our final inspection and placed with the carrier. At this point it is **safe to inform the consignee** of the tracking number as it will not change.

## Evaluating Error Responses

We currently return two different error models, with and without context. All errors will include a `message` node while errors with `context` will include additional information designed to save you time when encountering highly probable errors. For example, when you send us a request to create a duplicate order, we will reject your request and the context will include the FDC order `id` so that you may record it for your records.

### Without Context

New order with missing required fields.

\| Header \| Response \|
\| ------ \| -------- \|
\| Status \| `400 Bad Request` \|

```javascript
{    
  "message": "Invalid request body"
}
```

### With Context

New order with duplicate `merchantOrderId`.

\| Header \| Response \|
\| ------ \| -------- \|
\| Status \| `409 Conflict` \|

```javascript
{
  "message": "Duplicate Order",
  "context": {
    "id": 123
  }
}
```

## Status Codes

Codes are a concatenation of State, Stage, and Detail.

`^([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})$`

    <h2>Encoding</h2>
    <p>The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.</p>

    <h2>Returned values</h2>
    <p>The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.</p>
    <p>
        If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range <code>4xx</code> (client-side error) or
        <code>5xx</code> (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information
        about the error in JSON format, with <code>exception</code> and <code>message</code> values.
    </p>

    <h2>URL limitations</h2>
    <p>
        All the requests are semantically <code>GET</code>. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues
        with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a <code>POST</code> request with all
        the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>
        POST /s1/sentiment
        Content-Type: application/json

        {"text":"There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out."}
    </code></pre>
    <p>This is equivalent to <code>GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...</code></p>

    <h2>Request limitations</h2>
    <p>
        The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The maximum allowed size of any
        POST request body is <em>512 KiB</em>. For request with a URL resource, the maximum allowed number of
        extracted characters from each such resource is <em>100,000</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>
        By using the API, you agree to our
        <a href="https://www.geneea.com/terms.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.
    </p>

# Explore our APIs

## Get started

1. [Sign up for GraphHopper](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976025)
2. [Create an API key](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976027)

Each API part has its own documentation. Jump to the desired API part and learn about the API through the given examples and tutorials.

In addition, for each API there are specific sample requests that you can send via Insomnia or Postman to see what the requests and responses look like.

## Insomnia

To explore our APIs with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), follow these steps:

1. Open Insomnia and Import [our workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/GraphHopper-Direction-API-Insomnia.json).
2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your workspace: Manage Environments -> Base Environment -> `"api_key": your API key`
3. Start exploring

![Insomnia](./img/insomnia.png)

## Postman

To explore our APIs with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), follow these steps:

1. Import our [request collections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/graphhopper_directions_api.postman_collection.json) as well as our [environment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/graphhopper_directions_api.postman_environment.json).
2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your environment: `"api_key": your API key`
3. Start exploring

![Postman](./img/postman.png)

## API Client Libraries

To speed up development and make coding easier, we offer the following client libraries:

 * [JavaScript client](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client) - try the [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/)
 * [Others](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients) like C#, Ruby, PHP, Python, ... automatically created for the Route Optimization API

### Bandwidth reduction

If you create your own client, make sure it supports http/2 and gzipped responses for best speed.

If you use the Matrix, the Route Optimization API or the Cluster API and want to solve large problems, we recommend you to reduce bandwidth
by [compressing your POST request](https://gist.github.com/karussell/82851e303ea7b3459b2dea01f18949f4)
and specifying the header as follows: `Content-Encoding: gzip`. This will also avoid the HTTP 413 error "Request Entity Too Large".

# Map Data and Routing Profiles

Currently, our main data source is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). We also integrated other network data providers.
This chapter gives an overview about the options you have.

## OpenStreetMap

#### Geographical Coverage

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the whole world. If you want to see for yourself if we can provide data suitable for your region,
please visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/).
You can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, e.g. a weight limit for a bridge.
[Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data. If you have edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at the latest.

#### Supported Vehicle Profiles

The Routing, Matrix and Route Optimization APIs support the following vehicle profiles:

Name       \| Description           \| Restrictions              \| Icon
-----------\|:----------------------\|:--------------------------\|:---------------------------------------------------------
car        \| Car mode              \| car access                \| ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png)
small_truck\| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily \| height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg \| ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)
truck      \| Truck like a MAN or Mercedes-Benz Actros \| height=3.7m, width=2.6+0.5m, length=12m, weight=13000 + 13000 kg, hgv=yes, 3 Axes \| ![truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/truck.png)
scooter    \| Moped mode \| Fast inner city, often used for food delivery, is able to ignore certain bollards, maximum speed of roughly 50km/h \| ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png)
foot       \| Pedestrian or walking without dangerous [SAC-scales](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:sac_scale) \| foot access         \| ![foot image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/foot.png)
hike       \| Pedestrian or walking with priority for more beautiful hiking tours and potentially a bit longer than `foot`. Walking duration is influenced by elevation differences.  \| foot access         \| ![hike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/hike.png)
bike       \| Trekking bike avoiding hills \| bike access  \| ![bike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/bike.png)
mtb        \| Mountainbike          \| bike access         \| ![Mountainbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/mtb.png)
racingbike\| Bike preferring roads \| bike access         \| ![racingbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/racingbike.png)

Please note:

 * all motor vehicles (`car`, `small_truck`, `truck` and `scooter`) support turn restrictions via `turn_costs=true`
 * the free package supports only the vehicle profiles `car`, `bike` or `foot`
 * up to 2 different vehicle profiles can be used in a single optimization request. The number of vehicles is unaffected and depends on your subscription.
 * we offer custom vehicle profiles with different properties, different speed profiles or different access options. To find out more about custom profiles, please [contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/).
 * a sophisticated `motorcycle` profile is available up on request. It is powered by the [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/en) Routing API and favors curves and slopes while avoiding cities and highways.
 
## TomTom

If you want to include traffic, you can purchase the TomTom Add-on.
This Add-on only uses TomTom's road network and historical traffic information.
Live traffic is not yet considered. If you are interested to learn how we consider traffic information, we recommend that you read [this article](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2017/11/06/time-dependent-optimization/).

Please note the following:

 * Currently we only offer this for our [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API).
 * In addition to our terms, you need to accept TomTom's [End User License Aggreement](https://www.graphhopper.com/tomtom-end-user-license-agreement/).
 * We do *not* use TomTom's web services. We only use their data with our software.

## Introduction

The Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.

As an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:
* Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)
* Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)
* Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)

Also you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).

If you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:
* The type of integration you would like to develop
* Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project
* Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)

## Getting Started
To get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is `jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX`.

You’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).

Make sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like [Pagination](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-pagination).

**Example Request**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX" \
    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers
```

**Example Response**
```json
{
    "servers": [],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "page": 1,
            "per_page": 25,
            "previous_page": null,
            "next_page": null,
            "last_page": 1,
            "total_entries": 0
        }
    }
}
```

## Authentication
All requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header.

To create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.

**Example Authorization header**
```html
Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj
```

## Errors
Errors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object depends on the error code.

The error response contains the following keys:

\| Keys      \| Meaning                                                               \|
\|-----------\|-----------------------------------------------------------------------\|
\| `code`    \| Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable)          \|
\| `message` \| Textual description on what has gone wrong                            \|
\| `details` \| An object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) \|

**Example response**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_input",
    "message": "invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long",
    "details": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "broken_field",
          "messages": ["is too long"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Labels
Labels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.

Valid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).

Valid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.

The `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.

**Example Labels**
```json
{
  "labels": {
    "environment":"development",
    "service":"backend",
    "example.com/my":"label",
    "just-a-key":""
  }
}
```

## Label Selector
For resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using the label selector query language.

\| Expression           \| Meaning                                                             \|
\|----------------------\|---------------------------------------------------------------------\|
\| `k==v` / `k=v`       \| Value of key `k` does equal value `v`                               \|
\| `k!=v`               \| Value of key `k` does not equal value `v`                           \|
\| `k`                  \| Key `k` is present                                                  \|
\| `!k`                 \| Key `k` is not present                                              \|
\| `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    \| Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`                             \|
\| `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` \| Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor `v3`                \|
\| `k1==v,!k2`          \| Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not present                \|

### Examples
* Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:

  `env=production,type!=database`
* Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:

    `env in (testing,staging)`
* Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:

    `!type`

## Pagination
Responses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:

* A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page is 1.
* A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified in the documentation.

Responses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.

Additionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with pagination information:

**Example Pagination**
```json
{
    "servers": [...],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "page": 2,
            "per_page": 25,
            "previous_page": 1,
            "next_page": 3,
            "last_page": 4,
            "total_entries": 100
        }
    }
}
```

The keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of entries is unknown.

**Example Pagination Link header**
```bash
Link: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel="prev",
      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel="next",
      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel="last"
```

Line breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only contain some of the above `rel` values.

## Rate Limiting
All requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.

* The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.
* The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.
* The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full number of requests available again.

The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.

## Server Metadata
Your Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The following data is available:

\| Data              \| Format \| Contents                                                     \|
\|-------------------\|--------\|--------------------------------------------------------------\|
\| hostname          \| text   \| Name of the Server as set in the api                         \|
\| instance-id       \| number \| ID of the server                                             \|
\| public-ipv4       \| text   \| Primary public IPv4 address                                  \|
\| private-networks  \| yaml   \| Details about the private networks the Server is attached to \|
\| availability-zone \| text   \| Name of the availability zone that Server runs in            \|
\| region            \| text   \| Network zone, e.g. eu-central                                \|

## Sorting
Some responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.

**Example: Sorting**
```bash
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc
``` | No | Yes | Unknown |
| [Hong Kong GeoData Store](https://geodata.gov.hk/gs/) | API for accessing geo-data of Hong Kong | No | Yes | Unknown |
| [IBGE](https://servicodados.ibge.gov.br/api/docs/) | Aggregate services of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) | No | Yes | Unknown |
| [Ideal-postcodes API Reference - Ideal Postcodes](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/support) | # Getting Started

## Overview

### Access

All API methods are either a `GET`, `POST` or `OPTIONS` request.

The API communicates over both HTTPS and plain HTTP using IPv4 and IPv6.

We recommend using HTTPS only although HTTP is available.

We use appropriate HTTP status codes where possible to indicate the request status.

### Rate Limiting

Each IP address is rate limited at 30 requests per second. Tripping the rate limit will result in a 503 response.

The autocomplete API also has an additional rate limit.

If you expect to breach the limit please contact us and we can move you to an endpoint with a higher limit.

### JSONP

[JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) requests are supported. Include a `callback=` in your request as a query parameter. Your results return wrapped in a function designated by your request.

## Authentication

Most requests require an **API key** for authentication. Authenticate by passing an `api_key` as part of the query string. For example:

```
api.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/v1/autocomplete/addresses?api_key=iddqd&q=parkside
```

Alternatively, authentication can be transmitted via the `Authorization` header using the following scheme:

```
Authorization: api_key="iddqd" [other_key="foo"]
```

## Versioning

This API is versioned with a simple prefix in the URL. The current version is `/v1/`. We will maintain backwards-compatibility by releasing breaking changes under a new version.

Please note that the following changes are backwards-compatible:

- Adding new properties to existing API responses
- Adding new API endpoints
- Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints
- Changing the order of properties in existing API responses
- Changing the autocomplete address suggestion format

## Error Handling

A successful lookup is accompanied with a HTTP status code of 200 and a response code of 2000 (found in the body).

An error has occurred if the HTTP status code is not 200. Errors can range from a benign 404 (resource not found) to more urgent errors (your API Key ran out of credit, failed authentication, etc).

## Testing

Each new account comes with a free test balance. Contact us if you need more for testing and integration.

### Community Key

Our documentation and demos make heavy use of our community key `iddqd`. This allows for convenient access for trialing the API.

Many restrictions on this key are relaxed to allow developers make test requests. This key has a limit of 15 lookups per IP address per day as well as a daily usage cap. If you hit any limit restrictions, you can continue testing the API by creating a key of your own and using our free test methods.

Please be kind with the community key. We're trusting everyone to use it responsibly so that other developers may trial the API. Thank you!

## Metadata

Requests that affect your balance may be annotated with arbitrary metadata. This data is stored along with your lookup history and can be queried at a later date via the API or the dashboard. We call the ability to label your requests [tagging](https://docs.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/docs/guides/tags).

# Response Codes

The API returns two indicators to help you to determine the status of each HTTP request.

The first is the **HTTP Status**, which is found in the status-line of all HTTP requests. The API will return status codes that adhere to HTTP /1.1 Specifications wherever possible.

`2XX` status codes indicates success while `4XX` and `5XX` indicate client and server errors respectively.

The second is the **API response code**, which can be found in the `code` property of the response body. This code will provide a more specific reason if a failure has occurred and can point you in the right direction when debugging.

Please use the glossary of code numbers and HTTP status codes below when debugging your requests.

## 200 Request Success

| [Jumpseller API](https://jumpseller.com) | # Endpoint Structure

All URLs are in the format: 

```text
https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/path.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=storetoken  
```

The path is prefixed by the API version and the URL takes as parameters the login (your store specific API login) and your authentication token.
<br/><br/>
***

# Version

The current version of the API is **v1**.  
If we change the API in backward-incompatible ways, we'll increase the version number and maintain stable support for the old urls.
<br/><br/>
***

# Authentication

The API uses a token-based authentication with a combination of a login key and an auth token. **Both parameters can be found on the left sidebar of the Account section, accessed from the main menu of your Admin Panel**. The auth token of the user can be reset on the same page.

![Store Login](/images/support/api/apilogin.png)

The auth token is a **32 characters** string.

If you are developing a Jumpseller App, the authentication should be done using [OAuth-2](/support/oauth-2). Please read the article [Build an App](/support/apps) for more information.
<br/><br/>
***

# Curl Examples

To request all the products at your store, you would append the products index path to the base url to create an URL with the format:  

```text
https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX
```

In curl, you can invoque that URL with:  

```text
curl -X GET "https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX"
```

To create a product, you will include the JSON data and specify the MIME Type:  

```text
curl -X POST -d '{ "product" : {"name": "My new Product!", "price": 100} }' "https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

and to update the product identified with 123:  

```text
curl -X PUT -d '{ "product" : {"name": "My updated Product!", "price": 99} }' "https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

or delete it:  

```text
curl -X DELETE "https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```
<br/><br/>
***

# PHP Examples

Create a new Product (POST method)

```php
$url = 'https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX;
$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type: application/json'));

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "POST"); //post method
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, '{ "product" : {"name": "My updated Product!", "price": 99} }');

$result = curl_exec($ch);
print_r($result);
curl_close($ch);
```

# Plain JSON only. No XML.

* We only support JSON for data serialization.
* Our node format has no root element.  
* We use snake_case to describe attribute keys (like "created_at").  
* All empty value are replaced with **null** strings.
* All API URLs end in .json to indicate that they accept and return JSON.
* POST and PUT methods require you to explicitly state the MIME type of your request's body content as **"application/json"**.
<br/><br/>
***

# Rate Limit
You can perform a maximum of:

+ 240 (two hundred forty) requests per minute and
+ 8 (eight) requests per second 

If you exceed this limit, you'll get a 403 Forbidden (Rate Limit Exceeded) response for subsequent requests.  

The rate limits apply by IP address and by store. This means that multiple requests on different stores are not counted towards the same rate limit.

This limits are necessary to ensure resources are correctly used. Your application should be aware of this limits and retry any unsuccessful request, check the following Ruby stub:

```ruby
tries = 0; max_tries = 3;
begin
  HTTParty.send(method, uri) # perform an API call.
  sleep 0.5
  tries += 1
rescue
  unless tries >= max_tries
    sleep 1.0 # wait the necessary time before retrying the call again.
    retry
  end
end
```

Finally, you can review the Response Headers of each request:

```text
Jumpseller-PerMinuteRateLimit-Limit: 60  
Jumpseller-PerMinuteRateLimit-Remaining: 59 # requests available on the per-second interval  
Jumpseller-PerSecondRateLimit-Limit: 2  
Jumpseller-PerSecondRateLimit-Remaining: 1 # requests available on the per-second interval
``` 

to better model your application requests intervals.

In the event of getting your IP banned, the Response Header `Jumpseller-BannedByRateLimit-Reset` informs you the time when will your ban be reseted.
<br/><br/>
***

# Pagination

By default we will return 50 objects (products, orders, etc) per page. There is a maximum of 100, using a query string `&limit=100`.
If the result set gets paginated it is your responsibility to check the next page for more objects -- you do this by using query strings `&page=2`, `&page=3` and so on.

```text
https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXXX&authtoken=XXXXX&page=3&limit=100
```

## Access and Authentication

Some endpoints are publicly accessible without requiring authentication.
All endpoints affecting your Account, however, require either a Personal
Access Token or OAuth authentication (when using third-party
applications).

### Personal Access Token

The easiest way to access the API is with a Personal Access Token (PAT)
generated from the
<a target="_top" href="https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens">Linode Cloud Manager</a> or
the [Create Personal Access Token](/docs/api/profile/#personal-access-token-create) endpoint.

All scopes for the OAuth security model ([defined below](/docs/api/profile/#oauth)) apply to this
security model as well.

#### Authentication

\| Security Scheme Type: \| HTTP \|
\|-----------------------\|------\|
\| **HTTP Authorization Scheme** \| bearer \|

### OAuth
If you only need to access the Linode API for personal use,
we recommend that you create a [personal access token](/docs/api/#personal-access-token).
If you're designing an application that can authenticate with an arbitrary Linode user, then
you should use the OAuth 2.0 workflows presented in this section.

For a more detailed example of an OAuth 2.0 implementation, see our guide on [How to Create an OAuth App with the Linode Python API Library](/docs/products/tools/api/guides/create-an-oauth-app-with-the-python-api-library/#oauth-2-authentication-exchange).

Before you implement OAuth in your application, you first need to create an OAuth client. You can do this [with the Linode API](/docs/api/account/#oauth-client-create) or [via the Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/clients):

  - When creating the client, you'll supply a `label` and a `redirect_uri` (referred to as the Callback URL in the Cloud Manager).
  - The response from this endpoint will give you a `client_id` and a `secret`.
  - Clients can be public or private, and are private by default. You can choose to make the client public when it is created.
    - A private client is used with applications which can securely store the client secret (that is, the secret returned to you when you first created the client). For example, an application running on a secured server that only the developer has access to would use a private OAuth client. This is also called a confidential client in some OAuth documentation.
    - A public client is used with applications where the client secret is not guaranteed to be secure. For example, a native app running on a user's computer may not be able to keep the client secret safe, as a user could potentially inspect the source of the application. So, native apps or apps that run in a user's browser should use a public client.
    - Public and private clients follow different workflows, as described below.

#### OAuth Workflow

The OAuth workflow is a series of exchanges between your third-party app and Linode. The workflow is used
to authenticate a user before an application can start making API calls on the user's behalf.

Notes:

- With respect to the diagram in [section 1.2 of RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.2), login.linode.com (referred to in this section as the *login server*)
is the Resource Owner and the Authorization Server; api.linode.com (referred to here as the *api server*) is the Resource Server.
- The OAuth spec refers to the private and public workflows listed below as the [authorization code flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) and [implicit flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2).

\| PRIVATE WORKFLOW \| PUBLIC WORKFLOW \|
\|------------------\|------------------\|
\| 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. \| 1.  The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. \|
\| 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. \| 2.  Your application then redirects the user to Linode's [login server](https://login.linode.com) with the client application's `client_id` and requested OAuth `scope`, which should appear in the URL of the login page. \|
\| 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. \| 3.  The user logs into the login server with their username and password. \|
\| 4.  The login server redirects the user to the specificed redirect URL with a temporary authorization `code` (exchange code) in the URL. \| 4.  The login server redirects the user back to your application with an OAuth `access_token` embedded in the redirect URL's hash. This is temporary and expires in two hours. No `refresh_token` is issued. Therefore, once the `access_token` expires, a new one will need to be issued by having the user log in again. \|
\| 5.  The application issues a POST request (*see additional details below*) to the login server with the exchange code, `client_id`, and the client application's `client_secret`. \| \|
\| 6.  The login server responds to the client application with a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. \| \|
\| 7.  The `refresh_token` can be used by contacting the login server with the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `grant_type`, and `refresh_token` to get a new OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token`. The new `access_token` is good for another two hours, and the new `refresh_token` can be used to extend the session again by this same method (*see additional details below*). \| \|

#### OAuth Private Workflow - Additional Details

The following information expands on steps 5 through 7 of the private workflow:

Once the user has logged into Linode and you have received an exchange code,
you will need to trade that exchange code for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`. You
do this by making an HTTP POST request to the following address:

```
https://login.linode.com/oauth/token
```

Make this request as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or as
`multipart/form-data` and include the following parameters in the POST body:

\| PARAMETER \| DESCRIPTION \|
\|-----------\|-------------\|
\| client_id \| Your app's client ID. \|
\| client_secret \| Your app's client secret. \|
\| code \| The code you just received from the redirect. \|

You'll get a response like this:

```json
{
  "scope": "linodes:read_write",
  "access_token": "03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c",
  "refresh_token": "f2ec9712e616fdb5a2a21aa0e88cfadea7502ebc62cf5bd758dbcd65e1803bad",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200
}
```

Included in the response is an `access_token`. With this token, you can proceed to make
authenticated HTTP requests to the API by adding this header to each request:

```
Authorization: Bearer 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c
```

This `access_token` is set to expire in two hours. To refresh access prior to expiration, make another request to the same URL with the following parameters in the POST body:

\| PARAMETER \| DESCRIPTION \|
\|-----------\|-------------\|
\| grant_type \| The grant type you're using. Use "refresh_token" when refreshing access. \|
\| client_id \| Your app's client ID. \|
\| client_secret \| Your app's client secret. \|
\| refresh_token \| The `refresh_token` received from the previous response. \|

You'll get another response with an updated `access_token` and `refresh_token`, which can then be used to refresh access again.

## Requests

Requests must be made over HTTPS to ensure transactions are encrypted. The
following Request methods are supported:

\| METHOD \| USAGE \|
\|--------\|-------\|
\| GET    \| Retrieves data about collections and individual resources. \|
\| POST   \| For collections, creates a new resource of that type. Also used to perform actions on action endpoints. \|
\| PUT    \| Updates an existing resource. \|
\| DELETE \| Deletes a resource. This is a destructive action. \|


## Responses

Actions will return one following HTTP response status codes:

\| STATUS  \| DESCRIPTION \|
\|---------\|-------------\|
\| 200 OK  \| The request was successful. \|
\| 202 Accepted \| The request was successful, but processing has not been completed. The response body includes a "warnings" array containing the details of incomplete processes. \|
\| 204 No Content \| The server successfully fulfilled the request and there is no additional content to send. \|
\| 299 Deprecated \| The request was successful, but involved a deprecated endpoint. The response body includes a "warnings" array containing warning messages. \|
\| 400 Bad Request \| You submitted an invalid request (missing parameters, etc.). \|
\| 401 Unauthorized \| You failed to authenticate for this resource. \|
\| 403 Forbidden \| You are authenticated, but don't have permission to do this. \|
\| 404 Not Found \| The resource you're requesting does not exist. \|
\| 429 Too Many Requests \| You've hit a rate limit. \|
\| 500 Internal Server Error \| Please [open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open). \|

## Errors

Success is indicated via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_top">Standard HTTP status codes</a>.
`2xx` codes indicate success, `4xx` codes indicate a request error, and
`5xx` errors indicate a server error. A
request error might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted,
or a malformed request. A server error means something went wrong processing
your request. If this occurs, please
[open a Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)
and let us know. Though errors are logged and we work quickly to resolve issues,
opening a ticket and providing us with reproducable steps and data is always helpful.

The `errors` field is an array of the things that went wrong with your request.
We will try to include as many of the problems in the response as possible,
but it's conceivable that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in
new errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the process
of handling your request.


Within each error object, the `field` parameter will be included if the error
pertains to a specific field in the JSON you've submitted. This will be
omitted if there is no relevant field. The `reason` is a human-readable
explanation of the error, and will always be included.

## Pagination

Resource lists are always paginated. The response will look similar to this:

```json
{
    "data": [ ... ],
    "page": 1,
    "pages": 3,
    "results": 300
}
```

* Pages start at 1. You may retrieve a specific page of results by adding
`?page=x` to your URL (for example, `?page=4`). If the value of `page`
exceeds `2^64/page_size`, the last possible page will be returned.


* Page sizes default to 100,
and can be set to return between 25 and 500. Page size can be set using
`?page_size=x`.

## Filtering and Sorting

Collections are searchable by fields they include, marked in the spec as
`x-linode-filterable: true`. Filters are passed
in the `X-Filter` header and are formatted as JSON objects. Here is a request
call for Linode Types in our "standard" class:

```Shell
curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
  -H 'X-Filter: { "class": "standard" }'
```

The filter object's keys are the keys of the object you're filtering,
and the values are accepted values. You can add multiple filters by
including more than one key. For example, filtering for "standard" Linode
Types that offer one vcpu:

```Shell
 curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
  -H 'X-Filter: { "class": "standard", "vcpus": 1 }'
```

In the above example, both filters are combined with an "and" operation.
However, if you wanted either Types with one vcpu or Types in our "standard"
class, you can add an operator:

 ```Shell
curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
  -H 'X-Filter: { "+or": [ { "vcpus": 1 }, { "class": "standard" } ] }'
```

Each filter in the `+or` array is its own filter object, and all conditions
in it are combined with an "and" operation as they were in the previous example.

Other operators are also available. Operators are keys of a Filter JSON
object. Their value must be of the appropriate type, and they are evaluated
as described below:

\| OPERATOR \| TYPE   \| DESCRIPTION                       \|
\|----------\|--------\|-----------------------------------\|
\| +and     \| array  \| All conditions must be true.       \|
\| +or      \| array  \| One condition must be true.        \|
\| +gt      \| number \| Value must be greater than number. \|
\| +gte     \| number \| Value must be greater than or equal to number. \|
\| +lt      \| number \| Value must be less than number. \|
\| +lte     \| number \| Value must be less than or equal to number. \|
\| +contains \| string \| Given string must be in the value. \|
\| +neq      \| string \| Does not equal the value.          \|
\| +order_by \| string \| Attribute to order the results by - must be filterable. \|
\| +order    \| string \| Either "asc" or "desc". Defaults to "asc". Requires `+order_by`. \|

For example, filtering for [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)
that offer memory equal to or higher than 61440:

```Shell
curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \
  -H '
    X-Filter: {
      "memory": {
        "+gte": 61440
      }
    }'
```

You can combine and nest operators to construct arbitrarily-complex queries.
For example, give me all [Linode Types](/docs/api/linode-types/)
which are either `standard` or `highmem` class, or
have between 12 and 20 vcpus:

```Shell
curl "https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types" \

## Time Values

All times returned by the API are in UTC, regardless of the timezone configured within your user's profile (see `timezone` property within [Profile View](/docs/api/profile/#profile-view__responses)).

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits on API requests help maintain the health and stability of the Linode API. Accordingly, every endpoint of the Linode API applies a rate limit on a per user basis as determined by OAuth token for authenticated requests or IP address for public endpoints.

Each rate limit consists of a total number of requests and a time window. For example, if an endpoint has a rate limit of 800 requests per minute, then up to 800 requests over a one minute window are permitted. Subsequent requests to an endpoint after hitting a rate limit return a 429 error. You can successfully remake requests to that endpoint after the rate limit window resets.

### Linode APIv4 Rate Limits

With the Linode API, you can generally make up to 1,600 general API requests every two minutes. Additionally, all endpoints have a rate limit of 800 requests per minute unless otherwise specified below.

**Note:** There may be rate limiting applied at other levels outside of the API, for example, at the load balancer.

Creating Linodes has a dedicated rate limit of 10 requests per 30 seconds. That endpoint is:

* [Linode Create](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create)

`/stats` endpoints have their own dedicated rate limits of 100 requests per minute. These endpoints are:

* [View Linode Statistics](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-statistics-view)
* [View Linode Statistics (year/month)](/docs/api/linode-instances/#statistics-yearmonth-view)
* [View NodeBalancer Statistics](/docs/api/nodebalancers/#nodebalancer-statistics-view)
* [List Managed Stats](/docs/api/managed/#managed-stats-list)

Object Storage endpoints have a dedicated rate limit of 750 requests per second. The Object Storage endpoints are:

* [Object Storage Endpoints](/docs/api/object-storage/)

Opening Support Tickets has a dedicated rate limit of 2 requests per minute. That endpoint is:

* [Open Support Ticket](/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)

Accepting Service Transfers has a dedicated rate limit of 2 requests per minute. That endpoint is:

* [Service Transfer Accept](/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept)

### Rate Limit HTTP Response Headers

The Linode API includes the following HTTP response headers which are designed to help you avoid hitting rate limits that might disrupt your applications:

* **X-RateLimit-Limit**: The maximum number of permitted requests during the rate limit window for this endpoint.
* **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: The remaining number of permitted requests in the current rate limit window.
* **X-RateLimit-Reset**: The time when the current rate limit window rests in UTC epoch seconds.
* **Retry-After**: The remaining time in seconds until the current rate limit window resets.

There are many ways to access header information for your requests, depending on how you are accessing the Linode API. For example, to view HTTP response headers when making requests with `curl`, use the `-i` or `--include` option as follows:

```Shell
curl -i https://api.linode.com/v4/regions
```

## CLI (Command Line Interface)

The <a href="https://github.com/linode/linode-cli" target="_top">Linode CLI</a> allows you to easily
work with the API using intuitive and simple syntax. It requires a
[Personal Access Token](/docs/api/#personal-access-token)
for authentication, and gives you access to all of the features and functionality
of the Linode API that are documented here with CLI examples.

Endpoints that do not have CLI examples are currently unavailable through the CLI, but
can be accessed via other methods such as Shell commands and other third-party applications. | `OAuth` | Yes | Unknown |

# General
The Loket.nl API is a RESTful API that exposes the data and features of the Loket.nl platform.
The API accepts and returns JSON and can only be accessed by registered users.
This documentation describes version 2 of the API.


Are you looking to partner up and start building an integration based on the Loket RESTful API? Please check out the steps for partners on our [website](https://www.loket.nl/koppelingen/koppelen-met-loket/) .

Have you received your client and user credentials from us? Check out the following Postman collection to help you start making your first API calls on our acceptance environment. We would recommend to install the Postman desktop app.

## Environments
The Loket.nl API has two different environments.
The first environment is the "acceptance" environment which is used during development and returns test data.
The second environment is the production environment which is to be used exclusively by approved applications.
Both environments have their own URLs.
* The acceptance environment can be accessed at https://api.loket-acc.nl/v2/ 
* The production environment can be accessed at https://api.loket.nl/v2/

## OpenAPI documentation
The endpoints are defined using the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification),
an industry-wide recognized standard for describing REST API's.

__Please note:__ the endpoint documentation in this portal is not designed to be fully compatible with any automatic code generation tools.

## Change policy
Over the course of time the API, and policies regarding the API can and will change. These changes are subject to the following guidelines.


The following states hold true for the change policy for this API.

* Loket.nl may sometimes introduce changes to the API and policies without advance notice. 
* Loket.nl will try to inform users of any (breaking) change in advance.
* Loket.nl will not be liable to you or any third party for such modifications or any adverse effects resulting from such modifications.
* Loket.nl will try to avoid breaking changes as much as possible.

## Notification periods
In regard to changes Loket.nl will strive to adhere to the following notification periods per type of change.
Due to our versioning strategy at resource level this API has the possibility to run multiple versions of the same resource at one time.
This allows for a window in which both the old and new version are available.
Allowing for a gradual move to the new version. 

\| Type of change \| Notification period \| Support period old version \|
\|------------------\|---------------\|---------------\|
\| Non breaking change \| 2 weeks \| no new version \|
\| Breaking change \| 2 weeks \| 6 months \|
\| Critical \| Due to the nature of these changes we might not be able to follow the normal procedure for change managment \| depends on the severity of the issue \| 


We define a __non breaking__ change as follows. Any change to the API that does not cause failures in the applications that consume that API.
  * Introducing a new optional field to an existing resource
  * Introducing a new endpoint
  * Introducing a new operation (GET/PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE)
  * Introducing a new optional parameter to an endpoint
  * Introducing a new version for a resource

We define a __breaking change__ as follows. any change to an API that could potentially cause failures in the applications that consume that API.
  * Changing an existing JSON element (name, datatype, pattern, min/max length etc)
  * Removing a JSON element, endpoint, operation or parameter
  * Introducing a required JSON element
  * Introducing a required parameter to an endpoint
  * Passing the `obsoleteDate` of a version for a resource

## Versioning
The Loket API uses two types of versioning. API versioning and resource versioning. 


__API versioning__

API versioning is done via the path where after the domain URL (api.loket.nl) the path starts with the API version. The current version of the API is V2.
The API version is expected to change rarely as resource versioning is available to tackle most issues that need versioning.


__Resource versioning__

Every __JSON__ resource in the API is versioned via the Accept header.
Allowing users of the API to influence what version is returned by setting the __mandatory__ accept header.
The Accept header of request should have a value like `application/json;version=2018-01-01`. 
Here, the second part of the header is used to refer to a specific version of the resource (2018-01-01).
When calling the API it is possible to supply other dates rather than the exact resources version(s). 
The businesslogic will select the version that is ON or BEFORE the given date.


__For example:__ let's say there are two versions of a resource.
These are 2018-01-01 and 2018-09-01. When calling the API you supply `application/json;version=2018-08-01`,
in that case the API will use the version 2018-01-01 as its the nearest version in the past.  


A response returns what `resourceVersion` was used and the 'obsoleteDate' of that version (in most cases this is NULL).
The `obsoleteDate` indicates when the resources version will no longer be available via the API.
With the introduction of a new version of a resource the `obsoleteDate` for the old version will be set to 6 months after the introduction of the new resource. 
Allowing consumers of the resource 6 months to incorporate the change. Failure to do so will likely lead to failure in the implementation.

In this developer portal you can find the service contracts for each, active, version of a resource.
If, only if, there are multiple versions of a resource you can select the corresponding schema at that resource.

## Changelog
The changelog for this API can be found [here](/Changelog).

We strongly advise every user ofthe Loket REST API the subscribe to the email feed. Please check out the link on the changelog page.


## Legal notices
Your use and access to the API is expressly conditioned on your compliance with the policies and restrictions related to the API. 
If Loket.nl believes that you have or attempted to violate any term, condition, or the spirit of these policies or agreements, your right to access and use the API may be temporarily or permanently revoked.  

# Authentication
Authorization in the Loket API is based on the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol. For general information on OAuth 2.0 we kindly refer to the publicly-available documentation, https://oauth.net/2/ 


An authorized user is required to call the Loket API.

__Note:__ This is an SSL-only API.

__Note:__ Only TLS 1.2 is supported.

\| Environment          \| TokenUrl                             \| 
\| -------------------- \| --------------------------------     \| 
\| Acceptance           \| https://oauth.loket-acc.nl/token     \|
\| Production           \| https://oauth.loket.nl/token         \| 

The following OAuth 2.0 flows are supported

* Authorization Code flow (standard)
* Refresh Token flow (extension on the Authorization Code Flow)
* SSO flow (single sign-on)
* Password flow

## Authorization code flow
For most clients only the authorization_code (and thus refresh_token) will be supported. 
Password grant type is not available for an external client.

Please click the link below to see documentation on implementing the authorization code flow by external clients.

__[Documentation on implementing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](./OauthCode)__

## Refresh token flow
After the authorization code flow yields a refresh token the refresh_token grant can be used to obtain an access/bearer token.
The expire time of the access/bearer is also returned in the response please take this into account.
With the refresh token flow the two factor step will be skipped.

_Refresh token request example:_
```
POST /token 
grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={RefreshToken123}&client_Id={Client123}&client_secret={Secret123}
```

_Refresh token response example:_
```json
{
  "access_token": "JESJDhMBy0NPTM9SiXmYAzW45clOiQ5wSyDq3VWluguGNoKym4WPSiJoTDx67TQ",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "refresh_token": "nGJtF6j6SeQbHAg",
  "two_factor_state": "None"
}
```
## SSO flow
The SSO (single sign-on) flow is based on OAuth 2.0 and requires the authorization flow to be completed.

__For more information see:__ [Documentation on OAuth 2.0 SSO flow (for allowed clients)](./OauthSSO)


__Please note:__ Among other things, it is possible to set up an SSO flow with both Loket en Werknemerloket.


## Password flow
The password flow is typically NOT enabled for external clients. Only by exception will the password flow be enabled for security (and practical) reasons.

_Password token request examples:_

```
POST /token 
grant_type=password&username={UserName123}&password={Password123}&client_Id={Client123}&client_secret={Secret123}
```
Whether client_secret is required is dependent on the configuration of the client.

# Authorization
In this section we explain how the API authorization service determines if a request is authorized or not.

## The authorization entities

\| Entity \| Description \|
\| ----\|----\|
\| Client \| Loket.nl used the client as an additional authorisation entity. By linking clients to activities clients can only perform those activities they are linked to. \|
\| User  \| Is linked to a client (by performing the authorization code flow) and to a set of rechten (configuration in loket.nl)\|
\| Module (product) \| Enables certain functionality for the provider/employer. Modules can be enabled and disabled on both provider and employer level.\|
\| Role \| Influences if certain "rechten" are available to the users with said role. It can also influence the scope of the data returned. For example: the API will deny an "afdelings manager" access to employee's that are not in the "afdeling" (department) that user is manager of\|
\| Activity \| Every action in the API has its own activity. Using the Open API 3.0 standard these activity names are incorporated in the documentation using the `operationId` and in most cases are named in the description of an endpoint.\|
\| Rights (rechten) \| Represent a group of activities.\|

## The authorization process
This flow assumes that both user and client are correctly configured and have access to the API. 

1. Does the client have access to the activity?
2. Does the user have access to the activity (through "recht")?
3. Does the role have access to the activity (through "recht")?
4. Does the provider/employer have the required module enabled for the activity?
5. Does the user have access to the specified entity/ID?

If the answer to all the questions above is yes then the request is authorized otherwise the request is denied with a HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).
See the simplified authorization flow in the figure below.

__Side note:__ users are linked to rechten and clients are linked to activities. This leaves room for discrepancies.
Where a client cannot perform the activity because the client is not authorized to call that activity even though the user does have the "recht" granting access to the activity.

![Loket authorization flow](../Authorization_flow_extern.png)

## Which users can use the API
In almost all use-cases a Loket user should meet the following requirements to successfully setup an integration with that user.

* The user must be a normal Loket user (so NOT a webservice user)
* The user must be active (not blocked)
* The user must have access to an employer 
  * For provider users this is done by assigning the user to the appropriate Team(s)
  * For employer users this is done by creating a user for or linking the user to the appropriate employer(s)
* The user must have all appropriate rights
  * For provider users this is done by assigning appropriate rights via Team (or alternatively, directly to the user)
  * For employer users this is done by assigning appropriate rights to the user on employer level


How to setup an integration is described in the [Authentication](../#section/Authentication) section.


__Side notes:__ 
* A user can have access to multiple employers with different rights per employer.
* Please note that users set up to use the SOAP webservices (webservicegebruikers) are in no way suited to perform calls to the RESTful API, these require entirely different user set-ups.
* User management on production is typically done by the provider (i.e. the accountant) and sometimes the employer. This is NOT something Loket.nl itself can do.

# Data

## Data types
The Loket.nl API accepts and returns JSON.
Comform the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) the following data types are supported:
* string
* number (point is used to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a number)
* integer (from OpenAPI)
* object
* array
* boolean

For most of these types, further specifications can be found in the `format` and `pattern` specifications in the service contract. 
For example a `format: date` added to a string field indicates a valid date must be supplied.

## Metadata
Fields of the type 'metadata' are fields for which the possible values can be acquired via the metadata endpoint of the resource.

The metedata can be obtained by appending /metadata to the current endpoint.
Using the GET verb the endpoint will return a JSON output with "all" the metadata for the given resource.
In some cases multiple requests are needed to obtain all the metadata required, an exmple is given below.
Typically different metadata endpoints are availalbe for the POST and the PUT endpoint.


If metadata endpoints are avaible for a given endpoint/resource is mentioned in the description of that endpoint.

### Example response
```json
{[
  {
      "field": "gender"
      options: [
          {
          "key": 1,
          "value":"Man"
          }
          {
          "key": 2,
          "value":"Vrouw"
          }
      ]
   },
   {
      "field": "country"
      options: [
          {
          "isoCode":"NL",
          "key": 530,
          "value":"Nederland"
          }
          {
          "isoCode":"BE",
          "key": 540,
          "value":"België"
          }
      ]
   }

]}

```


### Example urls

__Acquiring  metadata for a POST Wage__
```
/v2/providers/employers/employees/employments/{employmentId}/wages/metadata
```


__Acquiring metadata for a PUT employee__
```
/v2/providers/employers/employees/{employeeId}/metadata
```

__Multiple requests to get all the metadata__

In some cases there are metadata fields dependant on the selected value off another metadata field.
Such is the case when adding a new concept employee. This is done in the employer context while several of the metadata fields are dependant on the payrollAdministration context.


__For example:__

__Request 1__, first of a normal metadata request is performed. The response for this request will contain a list of payrolladministration for the given employer.
```
/v2/providers/employers/b869ded6-0659-4d8d-9a8a-f9e22425ec9c/jobapplicant/metadata
```

__Request 2__, when a payrolladministration is selected perform a second request to acquire the payrolladministration specific metadata.
```
/v2/providers/employers/jobapplicant/metadata/payrolladministration/54369214-14a1-41ab-892a-ea8438e34d6f
```

__Request 3__, if a `payScale` is selected perform a third request to acquire the `payGrade` for that `payScale`.
```
/v2/providers/employers/jobapplicant/metadata/salaryScaleType/54369214-14a1-41ab-892a-ea8438e34d6f
```

### Types of metadata
We diferentiate between two types of metadata.

1. Generic metadata field. The possible values for these fields are the same for every object no matter the provider, employer or employee etc. 
Examples are: country, gender and nationality.
2. Context specific metadata field. Examples of contexts are employer, payroll administration, provider and Loket.nl.
In most cases the possible values for these field are resources in themselves and can be managed via the API. 
If a metadata field is context specific the context is given in the description of the field. 
Examples are: function, department and leaveType.


__Note:__ some context specific metadata field can have multiple contexts. 

For example: it is possible to define an export set in the provider context. 
Making that export set available for all payroll administrations linked to the provider. 
It is also possible to add an export set in the payroll administration context. That export set is only available to that payroll administration.
When requesting the metadata of export set the user will be presented with a combined list of the provider and payroll administration export sets.

## Default values
Many fields in the API have a default value. 
In order to assist our API users to adhere to these defaults when creating a record (POST) we provide `/defaults` endpoints.

* An object returned by the `defaults`endpoint resembles a fully expanded GET-object of that resource. The only case when a part of the object is NOT fully expanded is for a metaData-object that does not have a default value (for example '"gender":NULL'). 
    * Whether an object within the resource is of the type metaData is indicated in the service contracts of that resource.
* Context is determined by the GUID given in the Path. Examples are employer, payroll administration, employee and employment.
* A scope is sometimes required to determine the defaults values. A scope could be a date by which Loket.nl can determine what default was active on that date. 
  The scope can be set by supplying additional paraments in the request. If a scope is required but none is given the currently active or last know value is returned.
* The fields with no default will be set to null (even if the field is normally non-nullable).
* Because the GET-object is returned the readonly fields are also returned.



__An example endpoint would be:__

```
/v2/providers/employers/employees/employments/{employmentId}/payrollperioddata/defaults
```

__resulting in the following output:__

```json
{
  "payrollPeriod": null,
  "shift": {
      "shiftNumber": 1
  },
  "payslipType": {
      "key": 2
  },
  "payslipText": null,
  "distributionUnit": {
      "key": "b14acd0d-75d7-4fc8-8b22-4a3924585cab"
  },
  "costCenter": {
      "key": 2
  },
  "costUnit": {
      "key": 2
  },
  "payrollComponents": []
}
```

__Note: Defaults endpoints are not yet generically available. If a Defaults endpoint exists this will be explicitly stated at that specific resource.__

## Date chains
For most of the resources with a startDate and endDate a chain is maintained. Chain meaning that no records can overlap in time.
Loket.nl has two types of chains.


1) __Broken chain:__ It is posible for gaps te exist between the records. It is also posible to add new records in between or before existing records aslong as no overlap occures.

2) __Linked chain:__ No gaps between records are allowed. Its only posible to add new records to the end of the chain resulting in the closing of the reviouse record with the start date -1 as end date.

__Note:__ Chains are sometimes maintained with an additional context. For example, For `benefits and deductions` the broken chain is maintained per `payrollComponent`. 
It is possible to have multiple active records for different `payrollComponent` never two active records for the same `payrollComponent`. 

## Custom export
For some GET (list) endpoints the API supports exporting (part of) the output JSON as a XML/CSV file. This is done by setting the `X-ReportInput` and `Accept` header.

The `Accept` header supports the following 2 options:
* CSV (text/csv;version=yyyy-MM-dd)
* Excel (application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet;version=yyyy-MM-dd)


The `X-ReportInput` is a custom header that requires a JSON object with the following structure as input.

The filename without extension for the report 'FileNameWithoutExtension'
delimiter --> The delimiter to be used. If not set "," is used
Array of objects 'fields' with 2 fields:
1. fieldName --> A Xpath reference to the field to be included in the export
2. reportColumnName --> The column name for the field
3. format --> Allows only for date formatting. e.g. dd-MM-yyyy for csv or dd-mm-yyyy for Excel (Excel only usses lowercase)
  3.1 For CSV: see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings
  3.2 For Excel: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/number-format-codes-5026bbd6-04bc-48cd-bf33-80f18b4eae68

__Example `X-ReportInput`:__
```json
{
"fileNameWithoutExtension":"MyExport",
"delimiter": ";",
"fields":
  [
    {
      "fieldName": "startDate",
      "reportColumnName": "In dienst datum",
      "format": "dd-MM-yyyy"

# Request
A request to the Loket.nl API consists of several components.
Each of these components are discussed in this section.

## Base URL
The API can be accessed at [https://api.loket.nl](https://api.loket.nl).
 The version of the API is specified in the URL. The current version of the Loket.nl API is version 2. To access version 2 of the API, one simply appends `v2` to the base URL. The full base URL of the API is therefore [https://api.loket.nl/v2](https://api.loket.nl/v2).

## Endpoints
The endpoints defined in the OpenAPI definition of the Loket.nl API are appended to the base URL. For example, the endpoint `/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees` can be accessed at [https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees](https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees).

## Path parameters

Most endpoints require path parameter(s) in order to specify the context of the request. For example, the endpoint `/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees` contains the `employerId` path parameter. A path parameter is a unique identifier that identifies a specific resource, in this case an employer.

## Pagination

The API supports two query parameters to control the pagination of the results: `pageNumber` and `pageSize`. Both of these query parameters only apply to endpoints that return lists of entities.

The `pageNumber` query parameter specifies which page of the collection to return. By default  `pageNumber` is set to 1 which returns the first page of the collection. Note: the pageNumber refers to the page (with a given number of entities), NOT to a specific entity within a page!

The `pageSize` query parameter influences the number of entities per page. By default `pageSize` is set to 250. Note that this default may change in the future. It is not recommended to depend on this default when developing for the Loket.nl API.

Examples:

* ```?pageNumber=2``` to return the second page
* ```?pageSize=2``` to set the page size to two

## Filtering

The API supports output filtering via the querystring parameter `filter`.

Filtering is possible on all fields of the following datatypes:

* string
* integer
* boolean
* date-time
* decimals

The following operators are available:

\| Operator             \| Description           \| Example                         \|
\| -------------------- \| --------------------- \| ------------------------------- \|
\| Comparison Operators \|                       \|                                 \|
\| eq                   \| Equal                 \| `city eq 'Redmond'`             \|
\| ne                   \| Not equal             \| `city ne 'London'`              \|
\| lk                   \| Like                  \| `city lk 'Lond'`                \|
\| gt                   \| Greater than          \| `price gt 20`                   \|
\| ge                   \| Greater than or equal \| `price ge 10`                   \|
\| lt                   \| Less than             \| `price lt 20`                   \|
\| le                   \| Less than or equal    \| `price le 100`                  \|
\| Logical Operators    \|                       \|                                 \|
\| and                  \| Logical and           \| `price le 200 and price gt 3.5` \|
\| or                   \| Logical or            \| `price le 3.5 or price gt 200`  \|

Both field names and values are case insensitive. It is possible to filter on nested fields by adding the parent object before the field with a '.' to separate them.
Do remember to URL encode the filter parameters.

### Examples

All employments with a cancellation periode in months (the value 4 corresponds to months time unit).

```

/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=cancellationPeriodTimeUnit.key eq 4

```

All employments with no endDate.s

```

/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=enddate eq null

```


All employments with an end date less or equal to 2017-01-01

```

/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=enddate le '2017-01-01'

```

All employees with a employee number greater or equal 1 and less or equal 5

```

/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees?filter=employeeNumber ge 1 and employeeNumber le 5

```

## Ordering

All Loket.nl API resources support ordering of the elements in the response on a specific field. 
All fields can be used in ordering. 
The list can be ordered in ascending or descending order, with ascending being the default one. Ordering on multiple fields is also  by using a ',' as a separator.

### Examples

Order employers by company name ascending

```

/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=companyName

```

Order employers by company name descending

```

/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=-companyName

```

Order employers by company name descending then by house number ascending

```

/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=-companyName,address.houseNumber

```

## Headers

In order to access the endpoints of the Loket.nl API, at least two request headers need to be set. 


__1)__ the `Authorization` header is required in order to authorize the API call. 
The value of this header is the word Bearer followed by a space and the access token acquired from the `/token` endpoint. 
For example, if the acquired access token is `AbCdEf123456`, the value of the `Authorization` headers would be:

```
Authorization: Bearer v69uloc3wcEFLePw2unot0FfAJfBocrvSwsrCo75JLUG7aE54zqSUnU
```

__2)__ The second header that is required for proper usage of the API, is the `Accept` header.
This header is used for the resource versioning feature and is therefore crucial for making sure the response remains the same when new resource versions are introduced.
The value of the `Accept` header differs per endpoint is defined in the OpenAPI documentation of the endpoints.

```
Accept: application/json;version=2018-01-01
```

__3)__ In case of a PUT and sometimes a PATCH a third header is optional the if-match header. This header is used for concurrency control.
Even though the header is optional we advise using this header on every PUT(PATCH) to ensure not losing data. 

```
if-Match: aslkhas987da09s8udasd09a
```

# Response

In addition to the responses defined in the OpenAPI documentation, the Loket.nl API also provides additional fields that give more information about
the response and the entities requested. This section will explain the full response given by the Loket.nl API by examining the example response below.


Example 400 response


```json

{
    "version": {
        "obsoleteDate": null,
        "versionNumber": "2018-01-01,
    },
    "messages": [
        {
            "code": 83,
            "id": null,
            "type": "BrokenBusinessRule",
            "description": "[field] has an invalid length",
            "properties": []
        }
    ],
    "_embedded": []
}

```


Example 200 response

```json

  {
      "totalSize": 1,
      "pageSize": 250,
      "totalPages": 1,
      "currentPage": 1,
      "version": {
          "obsoleteDate": null,
          "resourceVersion": "2018-01-01"
      },
      "messages": [],
      "content": {
          "id": "2b4c119c-527c-4cbb-a5b2-f3a11e4b76cx",
          ...
      }
  }

```

## Paging
* `totalSize` has an integer value indicating the total number of entities irrespective of the page size.

* `pageSize` has an integer value indicating the maximum number of entities returned per page. The page size can be influenced by setting the `pageSize` query parameter. See the section Query Parameters for more information.

* `totalPages` has an integer value indicating the number of pages the requested collection holds given the specific pagesize.

* `currentPage` has an integer value indicating the current page number. The current page number can be influenced by setting the `pageNumber` query parameter. See the section Query Parameters for more information.

## Version
The `version` object provides information regarding the resource version of the entity requested.

  * `obsoleteDate` contains the date of discontinuation for the requested resource version. The value of this field can be `null` indicating that the requested resource version is not planned to be obsoleted at the time of the request.

  * `resourceVersion` shows the version of the requested entity. The resource version can be influenced by setting the `Accept` header.

## Messages
The `messages` field contains a list of message objects related to the request made. Any warnings and errors will be communicated in this list of messages

  * `type` has a string value indicating the type of message. At this time the Loket.nl API supports five types of messages: `BrokenBusinessRule`, `Warning`, `Exception`, `ConcurrencyViolation` and `NotFound` .
  
  * `description` has a string value that describes the message that has occurred.

  * `code` is an identifying code for the message. Please note that this code may change in the future. See the documentation portal for possible message codes for an endpoint.

  * `id` relates the message to a specific entity in the reponse list. For example, in cases where a warning occurs for one of the entities in a list, the value of this field can be used to identify to which entity the warning applies. Currently implemented for endpoints where a multi-patch is performed (multiple actions are performed within one call) for example updating the status of one or more leaveRequests. 
  
  * `properties` an array that can contain additional information regarding the message. Currently not yet fully implemented.

* `_embedded` contains the list of entities as defined for each endpoint in the OpenAPI documentation. Please refer to that documentation for the contents of the `_embedded` field for each endpoint. For endpoints that return only one entity (detail endpoints) the `_embedded` field is replaced with a `content` field. The content of this field can also be found in the documentation for each endpoint.

## Headers
* `etag` header is returned with every GET of a detail (single resource). This header is used for concurrency controle
* `Expires` header is returned with every response to indicate how long a response can be cached
* `Content-Disposition` header is used in case of downloads to provide a file name

## HTTP status codes

The Loket.nl API supports the following http status codes.

\| Code \| Is returned when \|
\|------------------\|---------------\|
\| 200 \| The request to GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE and object was recived and processed succesfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning. \|
\| 201 \| The request to insert (POST) a new object was recived and processed succesfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning.\|
\| 400 \| The request was received but could not be processed. The reason(s) will be given in the response. The content type of the response may be text/plain for API-level error messages, such as when trying to call the API without SSL otherwise the content will be application/json.  \|
\| 401 \| The bearer token provided in the authorization header is invalid. Do not retry the request until a new (valid) bearer token is acquired. \|
\| 403 \| The user is not authorized to access the resource. The reason will be given in the response. Do not retry the request until the, configuration, issue is resolved. \|
\| 404 \| The resource requested was not found/does not exist. \|
\| 409 \| The give if-match header in a PUT request no longer represents the current state of the object. Please acquire the current state off the object, via a GET, and resolve the differences then try again. \|
\| 50* \| A unforseen error occurred. Please check the request if everything seems te be in order on your side contact the support team. Provide as much information as possible to resolve the issue. \|

Note: for a limited number of endpoint a so-called multi-patch may be performed (multiple actions within one call). In that case the status code will be 200 if at least on of the actions succeeds, if other any action(s) in that call fail(s) a message will be returned including the given id of that entity.

## Caching
The API uses the `Expires` header to indicate how long the item can be reused from the local cache.
In most cases caching is not allowed for resources.
Exceptions excist, such as pictures like the employer logo and the employee photo, in these cases the cache duration is mentioned in the description of the resource. | No | Yes | Unknown |

  <li>
    Since the database is periodically updated, this may <strong>very rarely</strong> result in certain cities
    being marked deleted (e.g., duplicates removed). By default, endpoints returning city data will exclude
    cities marked deleted. However, in the unlikely event that this occurs while your app is paging through a set
    of affected results - and you care about the paged results suddenly changing underneath - specify 
    <tt>includeDeleted=SINCE_YESTERDAY</tt> (or <tt>SINCE_LAST_WEEK</tt> if you're really paranoid!).

| [Opendatanetwork ODN API](https://opendatanetwork.com) | The Socrata OpenDataNetwork (ODN) REST API exposes public data, often continuosly updated and enhanced, from many thousands of public
government and non profit agencies.

Much of this data originating from independent sources is fused together to create new, and often
powerful, entity level data. The API, in addition to search and autosuggest capabilities for finding datasets,
enables data based comparisons across geographical regions such as states, counties, metropolitan areas,
cities and zip codes using highly vetted data providers such as US Census, BEA, HUD and others. Comparison data
is preformatted for easy and efficient display on a chart, graph or interactive map.

The API also exposes data organized by narrative style questions a human might ask. The questions can
be rapidly found using an autosuggest style index, and then used to directly access all data needed to
thoroughly and authoritatively answer the question. Retrieved data includes time series (temporally aligned),
tabular, map heavy (includes spatial boundaries), and auto generated unstructured descriptive text.

The ODN API does not duplicate API endpoints or services provided by public sector agencies, but rather,
returns context relevant pre-populated REST URLs, when appropriate, so the caller can access data
directly from the source.

The [open source](http://github.com/socrata/odn-backend) API powers [OpenDataNetwork.com](http://OpenDataNetwork.com), an [open source](http://github.com/socrata/opendatanetwork.com)
site; the site highlights myriad uses and provides API badges with contextually relevant API example
REST endpoints and documentation pointers.

Finally, we continuously add new dat sources which appear automatically in the API, so if your favorite data
source is not available, check back soon. You can also join us [HERE](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/join-open-data-network)
and receive updates or let us know which data sources you are most interested in.

## App Tokens

Registering for and including a [Socrata application token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html)
is _required_ for the ODN API. They can be passed either using the `app_token` parameter
or the `X-App-Token` HTTP header. | No | No | Unknown |

# Overview
Datamotion provides telematics infrastructure for mobile applications. 

Telematics SDK turns any smartphone into telematics data gathering device to collect Location, driving and behavior data. API services unlocks power of your mobile application

There are 3 groups of methods:
* 1 - user management
* 2 - statistics for mobile app
* 3 - statistics for back-end(s)

in certain cases you will need SNS or any other notification services. read more [here](https://docs.telematicssdk.com/platform-features/sns)
# Possible architecture

There are three common schemes that are used by our clients. These schemes can be combined
* Collect, Process, Store (required: 1&2)
* Collect, Process (required: 1& sns)

| [ShipEngine API](https://www.shipengine.com/contact/) | ShipEngine's easy-to-use REST API lets you manage all of your shipping needs without worrying about the complexities of different carrier APIs and protocols. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a first-class shipping experience for your customers at the best possible prices.

Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or service.

## Getting Started
If you're new to REST APIs then be sure to read our [introduction to REST](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rest/) to understand the basics.  Learn how to [authenticate yourself to ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/), and then use our [sandbox environment](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) to kick the tires and get familiar with our API. If you run into any problems, then be sure to check the [error handling guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/errors/) for tips.

Here are some step-by-step **tutorials** to get you started:

  - [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)
  - [Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)
  - [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)
  - [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)


## Shipping Labels for Every Major Carrier
ShipEngine makes it easy to [create shipping labels for any carrier](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/) and [download them](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/downloading/) in a [variety of file formats](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/formats/). You can even customize labels with your own [messages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/messages/) and [images](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/branding/).


## Real-Time Package Tracking
With ShipEngine you can [get the current status of a package](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) or [subscribe to real-time tracking updates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) via webhooks. You can also create [custimized tracking pages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/branded-tracking-page/) with your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.


## Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers
Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [comparing rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/get-shipment-rates/) using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment details yet, then you can [get rate estimates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/estimate/) with limited address info.


## Worldwide Address Validation
ShipEngine supports [address validation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/) for virtually [every country on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/countries/), including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Shorten.REST API Documentation](https://shorten.rest) | ## Introduction


The Shorten.rest API allows you to programmatically create short URLs (an &apos;alias&apos;) for longer URL (a &apos;destination&apos;).

Each alias you create can be used to redirect the end user (person clicking on the link) to one or more destination URLs

A default destination is always set and specific destinations can be set to redirect the end user to preferred destinations based on the user&apos;s geographical location (country) and device Operating System.

In order to use the Shorten.Rest URL Shortening API you can choose to bind your own branded domain, sub-domain or to use our default domain - Short.FYI 

 ### Destination Matching 

 When creating or editing a short URL (&apos;alias&apos;) you can choose to specify a destination for each country and OS ([Supported OSes list](#tag/OperatingSystems)) combination. 

 When a user clicks on the short link, Shorten.rest will examine the end user's country (determined by User's IP) and OS (User agent) and match the most suitable destination for each user. 

 (*) If no destination is set for a specific request combination Shorten.rest will use the default destination that exists within each short URL 

 (**) BRANDED DOMAINS: If the requested alias does not exist in our database - Shorten.rest will redirect the user to the default fallback you set within your dashboard under the ‘Alias Not Found Page Url’ value for a custom domain. 

 (***) Operating System (OS) destinations are stronger than a country destination! 
 For example - if you have a custom landing page that is targeting people in the USA and a second landing page that is hyper focused for people who use iOS devices - a person clicking on your link in the USA that is on an iPhone will be redirected to the iOS landing page, while all other devices will be redirected to the USA landing page. 

 \| OS  \| Country  \| Destination \|
\| :------------: \|:---------------:\| -----\|
\| iOS      \|  \| YourDestination.com/ios \|
\|       \| US        \|   YourDestination.com/usa \| 

 Shorten.rest will choose the YourDestination.com/ios url as the most suitable destination.

 ### Branded Domain Attributes 

 When setting up your custom domain you can include optional metatags and snippets ([Supported snippets list](#tag/Snippets)). These parameters (such as retargeting, tracking and conversion pixels) are populated and fired on click - at the time of the redirect. 

 By default the parameters you set in the domain setting will be included in all Short URLs associated with that domain. 

 You can always override the domain defaults for each URL by passing the appropriate variables when creating or updating a short URL 

 ### Setting a Custom string for an Alias (short.fyi/alias) 

 While creating a short URL you can specify which domain to use. You can choose to use your own branded domain or our default domain - Short.fyi. 

 Each Alias is unique within a domain they are related to. This means that if multiple accounts use you the same domain (for example short.fyi), if an alias is already taken you may not create a new destination for it.

 That said - If you would like to use a specific alias which is already taken - the only way to do so is to create it on a new domain you own and have attached to your Shorten.rest account. 

 ### Random Aliases 

 By default - unless you specify a vanity URI for your alias each URL that is shortened on our platform will have a random string generated by the API. This means that if the &apos;alias&apos; attribute of a /aliases POST request is not provided, or is an empty string, a random string of seven characters will be generated and returned as part of the POST response. 

 You can also place the @**rnd** macro within the alias field when you create a new alias, for example /vanity/@rnd, which might return an alias like /vanity/ZMAefRt, or /vanity@rnd, which might produce something like /vanityMRtvxadf. Only the first @rnd in an alias attribute will be replaced. 

 ### NOTES 

 ( * ) All methods of the Shorten.REST API require that your API key be provided in **x-api-key** header. 

 (**) All API parameters are case sensitive | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

Recommended approach for connecting to a Underwater GPS via the API is:
- If "GET /api/" times out, the Underwater GPS is not running (on this IP address)
- If "GET /api/" responds with 200 OK check that the api version returrned (eg "v1") is supported by the client (eg: also supports "v1").
- If the api version returned does not match what the client supports: give an error to the user and recommend upgrading. (Eg: response is "v2" while client only supports "v1")
- If "GET /api/" responds with 301 Moved permanently. "GET /api/v1/version" to check if the kit has a version earlier than 1.5.
- "GET /api/v1/version" will always respond with 200 OK on Underwater GPS earlier than 1.5 release.

| [U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Enforcement Case Search](https://epa.gov) | Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.
 CASE Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on civil cases entered into the 
Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) and criminal cases entered into the Summary of Criminal Prosecutions database.  
See Enforcement Case Search Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/enforcement-case-search-help) for additional information on searching civil and criminal cases. 
\
The get_cases, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_case_info end point is self contained..   
The recommended use scenario for get_cases, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:
\
 <b>1)</b>  Use get_cases to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.
 <b>2)</b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of case results.
 <b>3)</b>  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates, related to the returned cases, that meet the QID query criteria.
 <b>4)</b>  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.
\
In addition to the service endpoints listed above there are two detailed case report services, one for civil cases (get_case_report) and one for criminal cases (get_crcase_report). 
See the Civil Enforcement Case Report Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/enforcement-case-report-help) and the Criminal Case Report Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/criminal-case-report-help) for additional information 
on then data returned from these two services.

| [Va Benefits Intake](https://va.gov) | The Benefits Intake API allows authorized third-party systems used by Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), agencies, and Veterans to digitally submit VA benefits claim documents directly to the Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) claims intake process. This API handles documents related to the following benefit claim types: 

* Compensation
* Pension/Survivors Benefits
* Education
* Fiduciary
* Insurance
* Veteran Readiness & Employment (VRE)
* Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA)

This API also provides submission status updates until documents are successfully established for VBA claim processing, eliminating the need for users to switch between systems to manually check whether documents have been successfully uploaded.

## Background 
This API provides a secure, efficient, and tracked alternative to mail or fax for VA benefit claim document submissions. Documents are uploaded directly to the VBA so they can be processed as quickly as possible.

## Technical overview
The Benefits Intake API first provides an upload location and unique submission identifier, and then accepts a payload consisting of a document in PDF format, zero or more optional attachments in PDF format, and some JSON metadata. 

The metadata describes the document and attachments, and identifies the person for whom it is being submitted. This payload is encoded as binary multipart/form-data (not base64). The unique identifier supplied with the payload can subsequently be used to request the processing status of the uploaded document package.

To avoid errors and processing delays, API consumers are encouraged to validate the `zipcode`,`fileNumber`, `veteranFirstName`, `veteranLastName` and `businessLine` fields before submission according to their description in the DocumentUploadMetadata model and use the 'businessLine' attribute for the most efficient processing. Additionally, please ensure no PDF user passwords are used in submitted PDFs. 

### Attachment & file size limits
There is no limit on the number of files a payload can contain, but size limits do apply.

* Uploaded documents cannot be larger than 21" x 21"
* The entire payload cannot exceed 5 GB
* No single file in a payload can exceed 100 MB

### Date of receipt
The date that documents are successfully submitted through the Benefits Intake API is used as the official VA date of receipt. However, note that until a document status of `received`, `processing`, `success`, or `vbms` is returned, a client cannot consider the document received by VA. 

A status of `received` means that the document package has been transmitted, but may not be validated. Any errors with the document package, such as unreadable PDFs or a Veteran not found, will cause the status to change to `error`.

If the document status is `error`, VA has not received the submission and cannot honor the submission date as the date of receipt.

### Authentication and Authorization
API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name 'apikey'. [Request an API key.](https://developer.va.gov/apply)

### Testing in the sandbox environment
In the sandbox environment, the final status of a submission is `received` and submissions do not actually progress to the central mail repository or VBMS. 

Progress beyond the `received` status can be simulated for testing. We allow passing in a `Status-Override` header on the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint so that you can change the status of your submission to simulate the various scenarios. 

The available statuses are `pending`, `uploaded`, `received`, `processing`, `success`, `vbms`, and `error`. The meaning of the various statuses is listed below in Models under DocumentUploadStatusAttributes.

### Test data
We use mock test data in the sandbox environment. Data is not sent upstream and it is not necessary to align submitted test data with any other systems' data.

### Validating documents
Use the POST `/uploads/validate_document` endpoint to make sure your documents will pass system file requirements and
validations before you send them through the submissions process. This step is optional but decreases the likelihood
of individual document errors during the submission process.

Validations performed:
* Document is a valid PDF (Note: `Content-Type` header value must be "application/pdf")
* Document does not have a user password (an owner password is acceptable)
* File size does not exceed 100 MB
* Page size does not exceed 21" x 21"

### Upload operation
Allows a client to upload a multi-part document package (form + attachments + metadata).

1. Client Request: POST https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/
    * No request body or parameters required

2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes:
    * `guid`: An identifier used for subsequent status requests
    * `location`: A URL to which the actual document package payload can be submitted in the next step. The URL is specific to this upload request, and should not be re-used for subsequent uploads. The URL is valid for 900 seconds (15 minutes) from the time of this response. If the location is not used within 15 minutes, the GUID will expire. Once expired, status checks on the GUID will return a status of `expired`.
        * Note: If, after you've submitted a document, the status hasn't changed to `uploaded` before 15 minutes has elapsed, we recommend retrying the upload in order to make sure the document properly reaches our servers. If the upload continues to fail, try encoding the payload as Base64 (See below).

 3. Client Request: PUT to the location URL returned in Step 2.
    * Request body should be encoded as binary multipart/form-data (base64 also available - see details below), equivalent to that generated by an HTML form submission or using "curl -F…". The format is described in more detail below.
    * No `apikey` authorization header is required for this request, as authorization is embedded in the signed location URL.

4. Service Response: The HTTP status indicates whether the upload was successful.
    * Additionally, the response includes an ETag header containing an MD5 hash of the submitted payload. This can be compared to the submitted payload to ensure data integrity of the upload.

### Status caching
Due to current system limitations, data for the `/uploads/report` endpoint is cached for one hour.

A request to the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint will return a real-time status for that GUID, and update its status in `/uploads/report`.

The `updated_at` field indicates the last time the status for a given GUID was updated.

### Document Submission Statuses
**Important note:** a submission has not been received by VA until it has a status of Received, Processing, Success, 
or VBMS. Detailed descriptions of what each status means are found in this table.

\| Status        \| What it means \|
\| ---           \|     ---     \|
\| **Pending**   \| Initial status.<br /><br />Indicates no document package has been uploaded yet.<br /><br />Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status \|
\| **Uploaded**  \| Indicates document package has been successfully uploaded (PUT) from your system to the API server but has not yet been validated.<br /><br />Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status. Any errors with the document package, such as having an unreadable PDF, may cause an Error status. \|
\| **Received**  \| Indicates document package has been received upstream of the API and is awaiting Processing.<br /><br />The VA Date of Receipt is set when this status is achieved.<br /><br />This is the final status in the sandbox environment unless further progress is simulated. \|
\| **Processing**\| Indicates the document package is being validated, processed, and made ready to route and work. \|
\| **Success**   \| Indicates the document package has been successfully received within VA's mail handling system.<br /><br />Success is the final status for a small percentage of submitted packages with claim types, Veteran types, or exception processes that are not worked in VBMS. Most submissions reach a Success status within 1 business day. A small portion will take longer; however, some submissions may take up to 2 weeks to reach a Success status. \|
\| **VBMS**      \| Indicates this document package was successfully uploaded into a Veteran's eFolder within VBMS.<br /><br />On average, submissions reach VBMS status within 3 business days; however, processing times vary and some submissions may remain in a Success status for several weeks before reaching a VBMS status.<br /><br />Some document packages are worked in VA systems other than VBMS. For these submissions, Success is the final status. \|
\| **Error**     \| Indicates that there was an error. Refer to the error code and message for further information. \|
\| **Expired**   \| After a POST request, there is a 15-minute window during which documents must be uploaded via a PUT request.<br /><br />An Expired status means the documents were not successfully uploaded within this 15-minute window. We recommend coding to retry unsuccessful uploads within 15 minutes using the same submission in case of connection issues. \|

### Optional Base64 encoding

Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into text format, so that encoded textual data can be easily transported over networks uncorrupted and without data loss. 

Base64 can be used to encode binary multipart/form-data it in its entirety.  Note that the whole payload must be encoded, not individual parts/attachments.

After encoding your payload, you'll be required to preface your base64 string with `data:multipart/form-data;base64,` in order to allow our system to distinguish the file type. Your final string payload would look something like `data:multipart/form-data;base64,(encryption string)==` and close with the standard == marker.  Note that the multipart boundaries i.e. -----WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo and ending ------WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo- must also be included.

When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence, human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a <i>worker task template</i>, a <i>flow definition</i>, and a <i>human loop</i>.</p> <p>For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html">Get Started with Amazon Augmented AI</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Start a human loop with the <code>StartHumanLoop</code> operation when using Amazon A2I with a <i>custom task type</i>. To learn more about the difference between custom and built-in task types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html">Use Task Types </a>.

| [AWS Amazon Detective](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.</p> <p>The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.</p> <p>To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.</p> <p>Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management account designates the Detective administrator account for the organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.</p> <p>The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.</p> <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.</p> <p>The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add member accounts to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply tags to a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the delegated administrator for Detective.</p> <p>The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove their account from a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p> <note> <p>We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account."

| [Ebay Marketing API](https://ebay.com) | <p>The <i>Marketing API </i> offers two platforms that sellers can use to promote and advertise their products:</p> <ul><li><b>Promoted Listings</b> is an eBay ad service that lets sellers set up <i>ad campaigns </i> for the products they want to promote. eBay displays the ads in search results and in other marketing modules as <b>SPONSORED</b> listings. If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, refer to the <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-landing.html">Promoted Listings playbook</a>.</li><li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as "20% off" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. The data gives sellers the ability to review and fine tune their marketing efforts.</p> <p class="tablenote"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must have an active eBay Store subscription, and they must accept the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> before they can make requests to these APIs in the Production environment. There are also site-specific listings requirements and restrictions associated with these marketing tools, as listed in the "requirements and restrictions" sections for <a href="/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PL-requirements">Promoted Listings</a> and <a href="/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements">Promotions Manager</a>.</p> <p>The table below lists all the Marketing API calls grouped by resource.</p> | `OAuth` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Ebay Negotiation API](https://ebay.com) | The <b>Negotiations API</b> gives sellers the ability to proactively send discount offers to buyers who have shown an "interest" in their listings.  <br><br>By sending buyers discount offers on listings where they have shown an interest, sellers can increase the velocity of their sales.  <br><br>There are various ways for a buyer to show <i>interest </i> in a listing. For example, if a buyer adds the listing to their <b>Watch</b> list, or if they add the listing to their shopping cart and later abandon the cart, they are deemed to have shown an interest in the listing.  <br><br>In the offers that sellers send, they can discount their listings by either a percentage off the listing price, or they can set a new discounted price that is lower than the original listing price.  <br><br>For details about how seller offers work, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/offers-to-buyers.html" title="Selling Integration Guide">Sending offers to buyers</a>. | `OAuth` | Yes | Unknown |

| [Musixmatch API](https://musixmatch.com) | Musixmatch lyrics API is a robust service that permits you to search and retrieve lyrics in the simplest possible way. It just works.

Include millions of licensed lyrics on your website or in your application legally.

The fastest, most powerful and legal way to display lyrics on your website or in your application.

#### Read musixmatch API Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy:
Before getting started, you must take a look at the [API Terms & Conditions](http://musixmatch.com/apiterms/) and the [Privacy Policy](https://developer.musixmatch.com/privacy). We’ve worked hard to make this service completely legal so that we are all protected from any foreseeable liability. Take the time to read this stuff.

#### Register for an API key:
All you need to do is [register](https://developer.musixmatch.com/signup) in order to get your API key, a mandatory parameter for most of our API calls. It’s your personal identifier and should be kept secret:

```
  https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/v1.1/track.get?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
#### Integrate the musixmatch service with your web site or application
In the most common scenario you only need to implement two API calls: 
The first call is to match your catalog to ours using the [track.search](#!/Track/get_track_search) function and the second is to get the lyrics using the [track.lyrics.get](#!/Lyrics/get_track_lyrics_get) api. That’s it!

## API Methods
What does the musiXmatch API do?

The musiXmatch API allows you to read objects from our huge 100% licensed lyrics database.

To make your life easier we are providing you with one or more examples to show you how it could work in the wild. You’ll find both the API request and API response in all the available output formats for each API call. Follow the links below for the details.

The current API version is 1.1, the root URL is located at https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/

Supported input parameters can be found on the page [Input Parameters](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/input-parameters). Use UTF-8 to encode arguments when calling API methods.

Every response includes a status_code. A list of all status codes can be consulted at [Status Codes](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/status-codes).

## Music meta data
The musiXmatch api is built around lyrics, but there are many other data we provide through the api that can be used to improve every existent music service.

## Track
Inside the track object you can get the following extra information:

### TRACK RATING

The track rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is a song in musixmatch.

You can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular songs of an artist, of a music genre, of a lyrics language.

### INSTRUMENTAL AND EXPLICIT FLAGS

The instrumental flag identifies songs with music only, no lyrics.

The explicit flag identifies songs with explicit lyrics or explicit title. We're able to identify explicit words and set the flag for the most common languages.

### FAVOURITES

Can be used to sort tracks by num favourite to identify more popular tracks within a set.

### MUSIC GENRE

The music genere of the song.

Can be used to group songs by genre, as input for similarity alghorithms, artist genre identification, navigate songs by genere, etc.

### SONG TITLES TRANSLATIONS

The track title, as translated in different lanauages, can be used to display the right writing for a given user, example:

HALLELUJAH (Bigbang) becomes ハレルヤ in japanese


## Artist
Inside the artist object you can get the following nice extra information:

### COMMENTS AND COUNTRY

An artist comment is a short snippet of text which can be mainly used for disambiguation.

There are two perfect search result if you search by artist with the keyword "U2". Indeed there are two distinct music groups with this same name, one is the most known irish group of Bono Vox, the other is a less popular (world wide speaking) group from Japan.

Here's how you can made use of the artist comment in your search result page:

U2 (Irish rock band)
U2 (あきやまうに)
You can also show the artist country for even better disambiguation:

U2 (Irish rock band) from Ireland
U2 (あきやまうに) from Japan
ARTIST TRANSLATIONS

When you create a world wide music related service you have to take into consideration to display the artist name in the user's local language. These translation are also used as aliases to improve the search results.

Let's use PSY for this example.

Western people know him as PSY but korean want to see the original name 싸이.

Using the name translations provided by our api you can show to every user the writing they expect to see.

Furthermore, when you search for "psy gangnam style" or "싸이 gangnam style" with our search/match api you will still be able to find the song.

### ARTIST RATING

The artist rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an artist in musixmatch.

You can use this information to build charts, for suggestions, to sort search results. In the example above about U2, we use the artist rating to show the irish band before the japanese one in our serp.

| [Amentum Aviation Radiation API](https://amentum.space) | Our atmosphere protects us from a hostile space radiation environment comprising high energy particles of solar and intergalactic origin. Solar radiation is significant during unpredictable and short lived solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs); however, galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is omnipresent. The GCR intensity varies with latitude, longitude, and time due to effects of solar activity on the interplanetary magnetic field, as well as the Earth's magnetic field. Space radiation collides with gases in the atmosphere, leading to a complex shower of high energy radiation, the intensity and composition of which varies spatially and temporally. Excessive exposure to radiation can damage DNA and lead to long-term health effects such as an increased risk of cancer.  <br><br> Resulting radiation levels at commercial aircraft altitudes are greater than at sea level. Aircrew are classified as radiation workers in some countries; however, planning to limit their exposure, and monitoring, is generally lacking. Both real-time measurements and predictive models of radiation in the atmosphere are important to mitigate the radiation risk to crew. <br><br>
We host a RESTful API to models of cosmic ray induced ionising radiation in the atmosphere. 
The CARI7 and PARMA endpoints use models developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the Japan Atomic Energy Agency to  calculate cosmic radiation doses at a point. 
The Route Dose API calculates the same quantities along a great circle route between two airports using CARI7. <br><br>
API requests must contain a key "API-Key" in the header (see code samples). Obtain a key from  <a href='https://developer.amentum.io'>here</a>. <br><br>

Understanding the space radiation environment for a particular mission profile is becoming increasingly important. Commercial off-the-shelf electronic components  that aren't resilient to space radiation are now prevalent. Longer duration  missions to cislunar space, Mars, and beyond are placing astronauts at greater  risk of radiation exposure. <br><br>

| [AWS Amazon AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html">AppConfig User Guide</a>.</p> | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [Cisco PSIRT openVuln API](https://cisco.com) | The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) openVuln API is a RESTful API that allows customers to obtain Cisco Security Vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. APIs are important for customers because they allow their technical staff and programmers to build tools that help them do their job more effectively (in this case, to keep up with security vulnerability information).
For more information about the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API visit https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/discover/overview

For detail steps on how to use the API go to:https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/get-started/getting-started.gsp

This is a beta release of a swagger YAML for the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API

To access the API sign in with your Cisco CCO account at http://apiconsole.cisco.com and register an application
to recieve a client_id and a client_secret

You can then get your token using curl or any other method you prefer.

'curl -s -k -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST -d "client_id=<your_client_id>" -d "client_secret=<your_client_secret>" -d "grant_type=client_credentials" https://cloudsso.cisco.com/as/token.oauth2'

You will receive an access token as demonstrated in the following example:
 '{"access_token":"I7omWtBDAieSiUX3shOxNJfuy4J6","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3599}'

In Swagger, click on Change Authentication

enter the text "I7omWtBDAieSiUX3shOxNJfuy4J6" (which is the token you received)

| [Configuration API](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/community/topics) | The Configuration API enables you to create a platform where you can onboard your users as account holders and create balance accounts, cards, and business accounts.

## Authentication
Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

 ```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
...
```

Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-U "ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
...
```
## Versioning
The Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/bcl/v2/accountHolders
```
## Going live
When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the API key or the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/bcl/v2`. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [Pendo Feedback API](https://pendo.io) | ## Who is this for?

This documentation is for developers creating their own integration with [Feedback's](https://www.pendo.io/product/feedback/) API. If you are doing a standard integration, there's a really easy [Javascript integration](https://help.receptive.io/hc/en-us/articles/209221969-How-to-integrate-Receptive-with-your-app) that you should know about before you go to the effort of building your own integration.

## Authentication

API calls generally need to be authenticated. Generate an API Key at https://feedback.pendo.io/app/#/vendor/settings?section=integrate. This key should then be added to every request as a request header named 'auth-token' (preferred), or as a query parameter named 'auth-token'.

## Endpoint

API endpoint is https://api.feedback.eu.pendo.io / https://api.feedback.us.pendo.io depending where your datacenter is located.

## Notes

API endpoints are being added to this documentation as needed by customers. If you don't see an endpoint you need please contact support and if it exists we'll publish the docs here. The 'try it out' feature on this documentation page will probably be blocked by your browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header has its value set by the Feedback server depending on your hostname.

## Generating client code

This documentation is automatically generated from an OpenAPI spec available [here](http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json). You can use Swagger to auto-generate API client code in many languages using the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

You can then query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration with Amazon QuickSight.</p> <p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from external sources. </p> <p>IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wearable devices.</p> | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [AWS Amazon Elastic Block Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two snapshots. If you’re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the differences.</p> <p>You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the cloud to use for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots, you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon Web Services or on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p> <p>This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them effectively, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an Amazon EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.

| [AWS Amazon WorkDocs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p>The Amazon WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API actions, along with CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the user.</p> </li> <li> <p>eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the Amazon Web Services SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.</p> <note> <p>The pricing for Amazon WorkDocs APIs varies depending on the API call type for these actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>READ (Get*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WRITE (Activate*, Add*, Create*, Deactivate*, Initiate*, Update*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>LIST (Describe*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE*, CANCEL</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about Amazon WorkDocs API pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/pricing/">Amazon WorkDocs Pricing</a>.</p> </note> | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [Billbee API](https://www.billbee.io) | Documentation of the Billbee REST API to connect a Billbee account to external aplications.

## Endpoint

The Billbee API endpoint base url is https://api.billbee.io/api/v1 

## Activation

You have to enable the API in the settings of your Billbee account. In addition you need a Billbee API Key identifying the application you develop. To get an API key, send a mail to support@billbee.io and send us a short note about what you are building.

## Authorization & security

Because you can access private data with the Billbee API, every request has to be sent over https and must

* Contain a valid API Key identifying the application/developer. It has to be sent as the HTTP header X-Billbee-Api-Key
* Contain a valid user login with billbee username and api password in form of a basic auth HTTP header

## Throttling

Each endpoint has a throttle of max 2 requests per second per combination of API Key and Billbee user.

When you exceed these 2 calls, the API will return a HTTP 429 status code | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |
| [BulkSMS JSON REST API](https://bulksms.com) | ## Overview

The JSON REST API allows you to submit and receive [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com/) messages. You can also get access to past messages and see your account profile.

The base URL to use for this service is `https://api.bulksms.com/v1`.  The base URL cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies an operation and you may have to specify some path parameters as well.

[Click here](/developer/) to go to the main BulkSMS developer site.

In order to give you an idea on how the API can be used, some JSON snippets are provided below.  Have a look at the [messages section](#tag/Message) for more information.

Probably the most simple example

```
{
    "to": "+27001234567",
    "body": "Hello World!"
}
```


You can send unicode automatically using the `auto-unicode` query parameter. 
Alternatively, you can specify `UNICODE` for the `encoding` property in the request body. 
Please note: when `auto-unicode` is specified and the value of the `encoding` property is `UNICODE`, the message will always be sent as `UNICODE`.

Here is an example that sets the `encoding` explicitly

```
{
  "to": "+27001234567",
  "body": "Dobrá práce! Jak se máš?",
  "encoding": "UNICODE"
}
```

You can also specify a from number

```
{
    "from": "+27007654321",
    "to": "+27001234567",
    "body": "Hello World!"
}
```

Similar to above, but repliable

```
{
    "from": { "type": "REPLIABLE" },
    "to": "+27001234567",
    "body": "Hello World!"
}
```

A message to a group called Everyone

```
{
    "to": { "type": "GROUP", "name": "Everyone" },
    "body": "Hello World!"
}
```

A message to multiple recipients

```
{
    "to": ["+27001234567", "+27002345678", "+27003456789"],
    "body": "Happy Holidays!"
}
```

Sending more than one message in the same request

```
[
    {
        "to": "+27001234567",
        "body": "Hello World!"
    },
    {
        "to": "+27002345678",
        "body": "Hello Universe!"
    }
]
```

**The insecure base URL `http://api.bulksms.com/v1` is deprecated** and may in future result in a `301` redirect response, or insecure requests may be rejected outright. Please use the secure (`https`) URI above.

### HTTP Content Type

All API methods expect requests to supply a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. All responses will have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

### JSON Formatting

You are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON format rules. While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON documents, doing so may lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected results.

Good JSON libraries will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if you are manually generating the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON format. This include correct escaping of control characters and double quoting of property names.

See the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) for further information.

### Date Formatting

Dates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.

See the [Wikipedia ISO 8601 reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further information.

Specifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported. Times are also formatted in the 'extended' format `hh:mm:ss`. Hours, minutes and seconds are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to ensure that there is no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the API.

The format we look for is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z\|[+-]hh:mm]`

Examples of valid date/times are`2011-12-31T12:00:00Z` `2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00`

### Entity Format Modifications

It is expected that over time some changes will be made to the request and response formats of various methods available in the API.
Where possible, these will be implemented in a backwards compatible way.
To make this possible you are required to ignore unknown properties.
This enables the addition of information in response documents while maintaining compatibility with older clients.

### Optional Request Entity Properties

There are many instances where requests can be made without having to specify every single property allowable in the request format.
Any such optional properties are noted as such in the documentation and their default value is noted. | `Basic` | Yes | Unknown |

| [Getpostman Postman API](https://getpostman.com) | The Postman API allows you to programmatically access data stored in Postman account with ease.

The easiest way to get started with the API is to click the **fork** button to fork this collection to your own workspace and use Postman to send requests.


# Overview

1. You need a valid <a href="#authentication">API Key</a> to send requests to the API endpoints. You can get your key from the [integrations dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).

1. The API has an access <a href="#rate-limits">rate limit</a> applied to it.

1. The Postman API will only respond to secured communication done over HTTPS. HTTP requests will be sent a `301` redirect to corresponding HTTPS resources.

1. Response to every request is sent in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). In case the API request results in an error, it is represented by an `"error": {}` key in the JSON response.

1. The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the `GET` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman, and `POST` implies you want to save something new to Postman.

1. The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A `200 OK` indicates all went well, while `4XX` or `5XX` response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively.

1. Individual resources in your Postman Account is accessible using its unique id (`uid`). The `uid` is a simple concatenation of the resource owner's user-id and the resource-id. For example, a collection's `uid` is `{{owner_id}}-{{collection_id}}`.

# Authentication

An API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Postman API, in the form of an `X-Api-Key` request header.

> If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/integrations/services/pm_pro_api).

An API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.

For ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments) called `postman_api_key` and this [Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) will automatically use it to make API calls.

## API Key related error response

If an API Key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorised` response code and the following JSON response:

```
{
  "error": { 
    "name": "AuthenticationError",
    "message": "API Key missing. Every request requires an API Key to be sent."
  }
}
```

## Using the API Key as a query parameter

Every request that accepts API Key as `X-Api-Key` request header, also accepts the key when sent as `apikey` URL query parameter.

API key sent as part of the header has a higher priority in case you send the key using both request header and query parameter.


# Rate Limits

API access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption.


\| Header                  \| Description \|
\|-------------------------\|-------------\|
\| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     \| The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. \|
\| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` \| The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. \|
\| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     \| The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. \|


Once you hit the rate limit, you will receive a response similar to the following JSON, with a status code of `429 Too Many Requests`.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "name": "rateLimitError",
    "message": "Rate Limit exceeded. Please retry at 1465452702843"
  }
}
```

# Overview

Paylocity Web Services API is an externally facing RESTful Internet protocol. The Paylocity API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.
Paylocity supports v1 and v2 versions of its API endpoints. v1, while supported, won't be enhanced with additional functionality. For direct link to v1 documentation, please click [here](https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm). For additional resources regarding v1/v2 differences and conversion path, please contact webservices@paylocity.com.

##### Setup

Paylocity will provide the secure client credentials and set up the scope (type of requests and allowed company numbers). You will receive the unique client id, secret, and Paylocity public key for the data encryption. The secret will expire in 365 days. 
* Paylocity will send you an e-mail 10 days prior to the expiration date for the current secret. If not renewed, the second e-mail notification will be sent 5 days prior to secret's expiration. Each email will contain the code necessary to renew the client secret. 
* You can obtain the new secret by calling API endpoint using your current not yet expired credentials and the code that was sent with the notification email. For details on API endpoint, please see Client Credentials section. 
* Both the current secret value and the new secret value will be recognized during the transition period. After the current secret expires, you must use the new secret. 
* If you were unable to renew the secret via API endpoint, you can still contact Service and they will email you new secret via secure email.


When validating the request, Paylocity API will honor the defaults and required fields set up for the company default New Hire Template as defined in Web Pay.


# Authorization

Paylocity Web Services API uses OAuth2.0 Authentication with JSON Message Format.


All requests of the Paylocity Web Services API require a bearer token which can be obtained by authenticating the client with the Paylocity Web Services API via OAuth 2.0.


The client must request a bearer token from the authorization endpoint:


auth-server for production: https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token


auth-server for testing: https://apisandbox.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token

Paylocity reserves the right to impose rate limits on the number of calls made to our APIs. Changes to API features/functionality may be made at anytime with or without prior notice.

##### Authorization Header

The request is expected to be in the form of a basic authentication request, with the "Authorization" header containing the client-id and client-secret. This means the standard base-64 encoded user:password, prefixed with "Basic" as the value for the Authorization header, where user is the client-id and password is the client-secret.

##### Content-Type Header

The "Content-Type" header is required to be "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

##### Additional Values

The request must post the following form encoded values within the request body:

    grant_type = client_credentials
    scope = WebLinkAPI

##### Responses

Success will return HTTP 200 OK with JSON content:

    {
      "access_token": "xxx",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "token_type": "Bearer"
    }

# Encryption

Paylocity uses a combination of RSA and AES cryptography. As part of the setup, each client is issued a public RSA key.

Paylocity recommends the encryption of the incoming requests as additional protection of the sensitive data. Clients can opt-out of the encryption during the initial setup process. Opt-out will allow Paylocity to process unencrypted requests.

The Paylocity Public Key has the following properties:

* 2048 bit key size

* PKCS1 key format

* PEM encoding

##### Properties

* key (base 64 encoded): The AES symmetric key encrypted with the Paylocity Public Key. It is the key used to encrypt the content. Paylocity will decrypt the AES key using RSA decryption and use it to decrypt the content.

* iv (base 64 encoded): The AES IV (Initialization Vector) used when encrypting the content.

* content (base 64 encoded): The AES encrypted request. The key and iv provided in the secureContent request are used by Paylocity for decryption of the content.

We suggest using the following for the AES:

* CBC cipher mode

* PKCS7 padding

* 128 bit block size

* 256 bit key size

##### Encryption Flow

* Generate the unencrypted JSON payload to POST/PUT
* Encrypt this JSON payload using your _own key and IV_ (NOT with the Paylocity public key)
* RSA encrypt the _key_ you used in step 2 with the Paylocity Public Key, then, base64 encode the result
* Base64 encode the IV used to encrypt the JSON payload in step 2
* Put together a "securecontent" JSON object:
 
{
  'secureContent' : {
    'key' : -- RSA-encrypted & base64 encoded key from step 3,
    'iv' : -- base64 encoded iv from step 4
    'content' -- content encrypted with your own key from step 2, base64 encoded
  }
}

##### Sample Example

    {
      "secureContent": {
        "key": "eS3aw6H/qzHMJ00gSi6gQ3xa08DPMazk8BFY96Pd99ODA==",
        "iv": "NLyXMGq9svw0XO5aI9BzWw==",
        "content": "gAEOiQltO1w+LzGUoIK8FiYbU42hug94EasSl7N+Q1w="

| [Rev Asynchronous Speech-To-Text API Documentation](https://rev.ai) | Rev.ai provides quality speech-text recognition via a RESTful API. All public methods and objects are documented here for developer reference.
For a real-time speech to text solution, use Rev.ai's [Streaming API](/docs/streaming).

# Base Endpoint

The base url for this version of the API is

> `https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1`

All endpoints described in this documentation are relative to this base url.

# Quick Start

Follow the [getting started checklist](https://www.rev.ai/getting_started)

## Get your Access Token

You can generate your [access token](#section/Authentication/Access-Token) on the [settings page](https://www.rev.ai/access_token) of your account. This access token only needs to be generated once and never expires. You can re-generate your token, however this will invalidate the previous token.

## Submit a File

To submit an audio file for transcription to Rev.ai:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs" -H "Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"media_url\":\"https://www.rev.ai/FTC_Sample_1.mp3\",\"metadata\":\"This is a sample submit jobs option\"}"
```

You’ll receive a response like this:

~~~
{
  "id": "Umx5c6F7pH7r",
  "created_on": "2018-09-15T05:14:38.13",
  "name": "sample.mp3",
  "metadata": "This is a sample submit jobs option for multipart",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
~~~

The `id` (in this case `Umx5c6F7pH7r`) will allow you to retrieve your transcript.

## Get Your Transcript

Once a transcription job's `status` becomes `transcribed`, you can retrieve the transcript in JSON format by running:

```
curl -X GET "https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs/{id}/transcript" -H "Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.rev.transcript.v1.0+json"
```

Alternatively you can get the plain text version by running:

```
curl -X GET "https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs/{id}/transcript" -H "Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Accept: text/plain"
```

You can poll for the `status` of your job by querying for the job periodically:

```
curl -X GET https://api.rev.ai/speechtotext/v1/jobs/{id} -H "Authorization: Bearer $REV_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Note:** Polling is NOT recommended in a production server. Rather, use [webhooks](#section/Webhooks) to asynchronously receive notifications once the transcription job completes

If you have any further questions, contact us at <support@rev.ai>

# Submitting Files

Two `POST` request formats can be used to submit a file: `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`.

## JSON

This is the preferred method of file submission. Uses the `media_url` property to provide a direct download URL to the Rev.ai server.
This method supports the use of pre-signed URLs. Links to videos hosted on platforms like Youtube are not valid because they are not direct download links.

**Important note on presigned URLs:**
Signed URLs usually have an expiration time which is configurable. To ensure the Rev.ai server can access the link, make sure the expiration time is set to 2 hours or more.
In the event you plan on resending the same file, make sure to generate a new presigned URL.

## FormData

Used to send a local file to the Rev.ai server. This allows the customer to send the file directly from the host machine.
Certain limits apply to this format, see the [Async API Limits section](#section/Async-API-Limits) for more detals.

# Turnaround Time and Chunking

Often, especially for shorter files, your transcript will be ready in 5 minutes or less. It generally takes no longer than 15 minutes to return longer audios. If you require faster turn around time please contact <support@rev.ai>

Chunking is the act of breaking audio files into smaller segments. Rev.ai uses this method to decrease turnaround time of audios greater than 3 minutes in length.

# Webhooks

If the optional `callback_url` is provided, the API will make an HTTP POST request to the `callback_url` with the
following request body when the job either completes successfully or fails.

## Sample Webhook

**On Successful Transcription Job**

```
{
  "job": {
    "id": "Umx5c6F7pH7r",
    "status": "transcribed",
    "created_on": "2018-05-05T23:23:22.29Z",
    "callback_url": "https://www.example.com/callback",
    "duration_seconds": 356.24,
    "media_url": "https://www.rev.ai/FTC_Sample_1.mp3"
  }
}
```

**On Failed Transcription Job**

```
{
  "job": {
    "id": "Umx5c6F7pH7r",
    "status": "failed",
    "created_on": "2018-05-05T23:23:22.29Z",
    "callback_url": "https://www.example.com/callback",
    "failure": "download_failure",
    "failure_detail": "Failed to download media file. Please check your url and file type"
  }
}
```

**Important notes for using webhooks:**
The API will make a POST request, not a GET request, to the `callback_url`. The request body is the job details.
You can unsubscribe from a webhook by responding to the webhook request with a 200 response.
If a webhook invocation does not receive a 200 Rev.ai will retry the `callback_url` every 30 minutes until either 24 hours have passed or we receive a 200 response.

For initial webhook testing, you can try using a third party webhook testing tool such as [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/).

# Async API Limits

The following default limits apply per user, per endpoint and are configurable by Rev.ai support. If you have any further questions, contact us at <support@rev.ai>

- 10,000 transcription requests submitted every 10 minutes
- 500 transcriptions processed every 10 minutes
- Multi-part/form-data requests to the /jobs endpoint have a concurrency limit of 10 and a file size limit of 2GB
- POST requests to the /jobs endpoint that use the media_url property do not have a concurrency limit or file restriction. They are only limited by the first two bullet points

# Error Handling

The API indicates failure with 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes. 4xx status codes indicate an error due to the request provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). 5xx error indicate an error with Rev.ai's servers.

When an 4xx error occurs during invocation of a request, the API responds with a [problem details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) as HTTP response payload.

The problem details information is represented as a JSON object with the following optional properties:

\| Property   \| Description                                   \|
\|------------\|-----------------------------------------------\|
\| type       \| a URI representing the type for the error     \|
\| title      \| a short human readable description of type    \|
\| details    \| additional details of the error               \|
\| status     \| HTTP status code of the error                 \|

In addition to the properties listed above, the problem details object may list additional properties that help to troubleshoot the problem.

## Example Errors

```
// Bad Submit Job Request
{
  "parameter": {
    "media_url": [
      "The media_url field is required"
    ]
  },
  "type": "https://www.rev.ai/api/v1/errors/invalid-parameters",
  "title": "Your request parameters didn't validate",
  "status": 400
}

// Invalid Transcript State
{
  "allowed_values": [
    "transcribed"
  ],
  "current_value": "in_progress",
  "type": "https://rev.ai/api/v1/errors/invalid-job-state",
  "title": "Job is in invalid state",
  "detail": "Job is in invalid state to obtain the transcript",
  "status": 409
}
```

## Retrying Failed Requests

Some errors can be resolved simply by retrying the request. The following error codes are likely to be resolved with successive retries.

\| Status Code \| Error \|
\|---\|:---\|
\| 429 \| Too Many Requests \|
\| 502 \| Bad Gateway \|
\| 503 \| Service Unavailable \|
\| 504 \| Gateway Timeout \|

Note: With the exception of the 429 status code, it is recommended that the maximum number of retries be limited to 5 attempts per request. The number of retries can be higher
for 429 errors but if you notice consistent throttling please contact us at <support@rev.ai>. | `Bearer` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Sakari](https://sakari.io) | # Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Sakari Messaging REST API. 

Sakari provides an advanced platform to drive large scale customized SMS communication

REST is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.

To find out more about our product offering, please visit [https://sakari.io](https://sakari.io).

# Quickstart

For your convenience we have created a quickstart guide to get you up and running in 5 minutes. 

[https://sakari.io/blog/sakari-api-quickstart](https://sakari.io/blog/sakari-api-quickstart)

# PostMan Collection

We've created a simple set of examples using [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/) Simply click below to import these. You will need to setup three environment variables in PostMan - AccountId, ClientId and ClientSecret. Check out our PostMan blog post for more information

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/d616e273edc916a7a6eb)

# Finding your client id, client secret and account id

To authenticate against the API's you will need three key pieces of data
 - client id
 - client secret
 - account id

To retrieve these, simply login into [https://hub.sakari.io](https://hub.sakari.io) and click on the "cog" in the top right corner. In the popup dialog at the bottom you should see your API credentials and account id. If these are not visible you will need to click on "Request Credentials"

# Versioning

With any breaking changes we will introduce a new version of the API. The latest version is v1.

The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break.

# Testing

There are numerous tools available for testing the API's. We will include examples using curl and the client SDKs that we have created. If you would like to see an SDK in a language not currently available, please let us know.

# Throttling / Limits

Our API's have been specifically designed to support bulk messaging in a single API call. We therefore impose limits on the frequency of calling the APIs to prevent abuse or runaway processes. If you feel you need a higher limit, please contact us. If you hit the limit you will get a 429 error code returned from our servers

# Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:

```
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "CONT-001",
    "message": "Invalid mobile number"
  }
}
```

# Pagination

For performance, most GET calls return a subset of data. This data is paginated for easy access. Most APIs which return collections of data will return a pagination object as such:

```
{
  "pagination": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10
    "totalCount": 21
  }  
}
```

When making calls to the API, you can adjust the slice of data returned using query parameters such as:

`` https://api.sakari.io/v1/accounts/123/contacts?offset=20&limit=25 ``

This will return 25 contacts with an offset of 20. | `OAuth` | Yes | Unknown |

* Draft a new email in [Gmail](https://zapier.com/apps/gmail/integrations)
* ... and thousands more, with one universal natural language API

The typical use-case for NLA is to expose our ecosystem of thousands of apps/actions within your own product. NLA is optimized for products that receive user input in natural language (eg. chat, assistant, or other large language model based experience) -- that said, it can also be used to power _any_ product that needs integrations. In this case, think of NLA as a more friendly, human API.

NLA contains a decade of experience with API shenanigans, so you don't have to. Common API complexity, automatically handled:
* **Every type of auth** (Basic, Session, API Key, OAuth v1, Oauth v2, Digest, ...), Zapier securely handles and signs requests for you
* **Support for create, update, and search actions**, endpoints optimized for natural language usage
* **Support for custom fields**, Spreadsheet, CRM, and Mailing List friendly!
* **Reference by name, not ID**, humans use natural language names, not IDs, to reference things in their apps, so NLA does too
* **Smart, human defaults**, APIs sometimes have 100 options. Zapier's platform data helps us make NLA simpler for users out of the box

#### Two Usage Modes <a name="usage-modes"></a>

NLA handles all the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output. The key idea is you (the developer), or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API. NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.

1. **Server-side only** (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where your app will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)

2. **User-facing** (Oauth): for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing application and your app needs access to end-user's exposed actions and connected accounts on Zapier.com

#### Why Natural Language? 

Simply, it makes the API easier to use for both developers and users (and also for [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models)!)

We designed NLA to expose the power of Zapier's platform without passing along the complexity. A few design choices:
* There is a [user-facing component](https://cdn.zappy.app/83728f684b91c0afe7d435445fe4ac90.png) to NLA, exposed via a popup window, users set up and enable basic actions which "expose" them to you, the `provider`.
* The default action setup for users is minimal and fast. [All required fields are guessed](https://cdn.zappy.app/20afede9be56bf4e30d31986bc5325f8.png). This guessing is accomplished using an lanuage model on the NLA side.
* Users can [choose to override any guessed field](https://cdn.zappy.app/e07f6eabfe7512e9decf01cba0c9e847.png) with a fixed value or choice, increasing trust to use the natural language interface.
* Custom fields (ex. spreadsheet columns) can also be [dynamically guessed at action run time](https://cdn.zappy.app/9061499b4b973200fc345f695b33e3c7.png), or fixed by the user.

Using the API is then simple:

```
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "Add Bryan Helmig at Zapier to my NLA test sheet, oh and he loves guitars!"}' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/<ACTION_ID>/execute/'
```

Or mix in some fixed values:

```
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "Send a short poem about automation to slack", "channel": "#fun-zapier"}' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/<ACTION_ID>/execute/'
```

## Auth <a name="auth"></a>

#### For Quickly Exploring <a name="exploring"></a>

It's best to take advantage of session auth built into the OpenAPI docs.

1. [Log in](/login/zapier/)
2. [Create and enable an action](/demo/) using our `demo` provider

then all your enabled ("exposed") actions will be available at the bottom of the the **[dynamic API](/api/v1/dynamic/docs)**.

#### For Testing or Production (Server-side only mode) <a name="server-side"></a>

For development purposes, or using NLA in a server-side only use case, you can get started quickly using the provider `dev`. You can generate an `API key` using this provider and make authenticated requests.

Please follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Dev App provider](/dev/provider/debug/) debug page.
2. Look for "User" -> "Information" -> "API Key". If a key does not exist, follow the instructions to generate one.
3. Use this key in the header `x-api-key` to make authenticated requests.

Test that the API key is working:

```
curl -v \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/check/'
```

#### For Production (User-facing mode) <a name="production"></a>

The API is authenticated via [standard OAuth v2](https://oauth.net/2/). Submit [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1DWkLQ7SpSZCuZbTxcBB98gck10t) to get access and receive a `cliend_id`, `client_secret`, and your `provider` name (ex. 'acme'). You'll also need to share with us a `redirect_uri` to receive each `code`. This API uses both `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

Each of your users will get a per-user access token which you'll use to sign requests. The access token both authenticates and authorizes a request to access or run (execute) a given user's actions.

The basic auth flow is:

1. **Send user to our OAuth start URL, ideally in a popup window**

```javascript
var url = https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/authorize/?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&
    redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>&
    scope=nla%3Aexposed_actions%3Aexecute
var nla = window.open(url, 'nla', 'width=650,height=700');
```

2. **User approves request for access**

3. **NLA will redirect user via `GET` to the `redirect_uri` you provided us with a `?code=` in the query string**

4. **Snag the `code` and `POST` it to the NLA token endpoint `https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/token/`**

```
curl -v \
    -d '{ \
        "code": "<CODE>", \
        "grant_type": "authorization_code", \
        "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", \
        "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>" \
        }' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/token/'
```

5. **Finally, receive `refresh_token` and `access_token` in response**

Save the refresh token, you'll need to use it to request a new access tokehn when it expires.

Now you can use the `access_token` to make authenticated requests:

```
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json
```

6. **When the `access_token` expires, refresh it**

```
curl -v \
    -d '{ \
        "refresh_token": "<REFRESH_TOKEN>", \
        "grant_type": "refresh_token", \
        "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", \
        "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>" \
        }' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/oauth/token/'
```

## Action Setup Window <a name="action-setup-window"></a>

Users set up their actions inside a window popup, that looks and feels similar to an OAuth window. The setup URL is the same for all your users: `https://nla.zapier.com/<PROVIDER>/start/`

You can check the validity of an access/refresh token by checking against the `api/v1/check/` endpoint to determine if you should present the `oauth/authorize/` or `<PROVIDER>/start/` url.

You'd typically include a button or link somewhere inside your product to open the setup window.

```javascript
var nla = window.open('https://nla.zapier.com/<PROVIDER>/start', 'nla', 'width=650,height=700');
```

_Note: the setup window is optimized for 650px width, 700px height_

## Using the API <a name="using-the-api"></a>

#### Understanding the AI guessing flow <a name="ai-guessing"></a>

NLA is optimized for a chat/assistant style usage paradigm where you want to offload as much work to a large language model, as possible. For end users, the action setup flow that takes ~seconds (compared to minutes/hours with traditional, complex integration setup).

An action is then run (executed) via an API call with one single natural language parameter `instructions`. In the chat/assistant use case, these instructions are likely being generated by your own large language model. However NLA works just as well even in more traditional software paradigm where `instructions` are perhaps hard-coded into your codebase or supplied by the user directly.

Consider the case where you've built a chat product and your end user wants to expose a "Send Slack Message" action to your product. Their action setup [might look like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/d19215e5a2fb3896f6cddf435dfcbe27.png).

The user only has to pick Slack and authorize their Slack account. By default, all required fields are set to "Have AI guess". In this example there are two required fields: Channel and Message Text.

If a field uses "Have AI guess", two things happen:
1. When the action is run via the API, NLA will interpret passed `instructions` (using a language model) to fill in the values for Channel and Message Text. NLA is smart about fields like Channel -- Slack's API requires a Channel ID, not a plain text Channel name. NLA handles all such cases automatically.
2. The field will be listed as an optional hint parameter in the OpenAPI spec (see "hint parameters" below) which allows you (the developer) to override any `instructions` guessing.

Sometimes language models hallucinate or guess wrong. And if this were a particuarly sensitive Slack message, the user may not want to leave the selection of "Channel" up to chance. NLA allows the user [to use a specific, fixed value like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/dc4976635259b4889f8412d231fb3be4.png).

Now when the action executes, the Message Text will still be automatically guessed but Channel will be fixed to "#testing". This significantly increases user trust and unlocks use cases where the user may have partial but not full trust in an AI guessing.

We call the set of fields the user denoted "Have AI guess" as "hint parameters" -- Message Text above in the above example is one. They are *always* optional. When running actions via the API, you (the developer) can choose to supply none/any/all hint parameters. Any hint parameters provided are treated exactly like "Use a specific value" at the user layer -- as an override. 

One aside: custom fields. Zapier supports custom fields throughout the platform. The degenerate case is a spreadsheet, where _every_ column is a custom field. This introduces complexity because sheet columns are unknowable at action setup time if the user picks "Have AI guess" for which spreadsheet. NLA handles such custom fields using the same pattern as above with one distinction: they are not listed as hint parameters because they are literally unknowable until run time. Also as you may expect, if the user picks a specific spreadsheet during action setup, custom fields act like regular fields and flow through normally.

In the typical chat/assistant product use case, you'll want to expose these hint parameters alongside the exposed action list to your own language model. Your language model is likely to have broader context about the user vs the narrowly constrained `instructions` string passed to the API and will result in a better guess.

In summary:

```
[user supplied "Use specific value"] --overrides--> [API call supplied hint parameters] --overrides--> [API call supplied "instructions"]
```


#### Common API use cases <a name="common-api-uses"></a>

There are three common usages:
1. Get a list of the current user's exposed actions
2. Get a list of an action's optional hint parameters
3. Execute an action

Let's go through each, assuming you have a valid access token already.

### 1. Get a list of the current user's exposed actions <a name="list-exposed-actions"></a>

```
# via the RESTful list endpoint:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/

# via the dynamic openapi.json schema:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json
```

Example of [full list endpoint response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/), snipped below:

```
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX",
            "description": "Slack: Send Channel Message",
            ...
```

Example of [full openapi.json response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json), snipped below:

```
{
    ...
    "paths": {
        ...
        "/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/": {
            "post": {
                "operationId": "exposed_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX_execute",
                "summary": "Slack: Send Channel Message (execute)",
                ...

```

### 2. Get a list of an action's optional hint parameters <a name="get-hints"></a>

As a reminder, hint parameters are _always_ optional. By default, all parameters are filled in via guessing based on a provided `instructions` parameter. If a hint parameter is supplied in an API request along with instructions, the hint parameter will _override_ the guess.

```
# via the RESTful list endpoint:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/

# via the dynamic openapi.json schema:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json
```

Example of [full list endpoint response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/), snipped below:

```
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX",
            "description": "Slack: Send Channel Message",
            "input_params": {
                "instructions": "str",
                "Message_Text": "str",
                "Channel": "str",
                ...
```

Example of [full openapi.json response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json), snipped below:

```
{
    ...
    "components": {
        "schemas": {
            ...
            "PreviewExecuteRequest_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX": {
                "title": "PreviewExecuteRequest_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX",
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "instructions": {
                        ...
                    },
                    "Message_Text": {
                        ...
                    },
                    "Channel_Name": {
                        ...
                    }

```

_Note: Every list of input_params will contain `instructions`, the only required parameter for execution._ 

### 3. Execute (or preview) an action <a name="execute-action"></a>

Finally, with an action ID and any desired, optional, hint parameters in hand, we can run (execute) an action. The parameter `instructions` is the only required parameter run an action.

```
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "send a short poem about automation and robots to slack", "Channel_Name": "#fun-zapier"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```

Another example, this time an action to retrieve data:

```
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "grab the latest email from bryan helmig"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTA3G1WD49GN1XXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```

One more example, this time requesting a preview of the action:

```
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "say Hello World to #fun-zapier", "preview_only": true}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```


#### Execution Return Data <a name="return-data"></a>

##### The Status Key <a name="status-key"></a>

All actions will contain a `status`. The status can be one of four values:

`success`

The action executed successfully and found results.

`error`

The action failed to execute. An `error` key will have its value populated.

Example:

```
    {
        ...
        "action_used": "Gmail: Send Email",
        "result": null,
        "status": "error",
        "error": "Error from app: Required field "subject" (subject) is missing. Required field "Body" (body) is missing."
    }
```

`empty`

The action executed successfully, but no results were found. This status exists to be explicit that having an empty `result` is correct.

`preview`

The action is a preview and not a real execution. A `review_url` key will contain a URL to optionally execute the action from a browser,
or just rerun without the `preview_only` input parameter.

Example:

```
    {
        ...
        "action_used": "Slack: Send Channel Message",
        "input_params": {
            "Channel": "fun-zapier",
            "Message_Text": "Hello World"
        },
        "review_url": "https://nla.zapier.com/execution/01GW2E2ZNE5W07D32E41HFT5GJ/?needs_confirmation=true",
        "status": "preview",
    }
```

##### The Result Key <a name="result-key"></a>

All actions will return trimmed `result` data. `result` is ideal for humans and language models alike! By default, `full_results` is not included but can be useful for machines (contact us if you'd like access to full results). The trimmed version is created using some AI and heuristics:

* selects for data that is plain text and human readable
* discards machine data like IDs, headers, etc.
* prioritizes data that is very popular on Zapier
* reduces final result into about ~500 words

Trimmed results are ideal for inserting directly back into the prompt context of a large language models without blowing up context token window limits.

Example of a trimmed results payload from "Gmail: Find Email":

```
    {
        "result": {
            "from__email": "mike@zapier.com",
            "from__name": "Mike Knoop",
            "subject": "Re: Getting setup",
            "body_plain": "Hi Karla, thanks for following up. I can confirm I got access to everything! ... Thanks! Mike",
            "cc__emails": "bryan@zapier.com, wade@zapier.com"
            "to__email": "Mike Knoop",
        }
    }
```

| [Spinitron v2 API](https://spinitron.com) | ## Notes

**Tutorial demo** using this API is at [https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/). For web integration using iframes and/or JavaScript instead of an API, see [https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/](https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/).

**Your API key** is found in the Spinitron web app. Log in to Spinitron and go to *Automation & API* in the *Admin* menu.

**Authenticate** by presenting your API key using either HTTP Bearer Authorization
(preferred)

    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOURAPIKEY' 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins'

or in the query parameter `access-token` (less secure owing to webserver
log files)

    curl 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins?access-token=YOURAPIKEY'

**Limit** per page of results is 20 by default and miximally 200.

**Try it out** below works to
generate example cURL requests but not to get responses from Spinitron. We
do not accept queries sent from web browsers. Copy-paste the cURL commands
and run them from your computer.

**Cache** the data you get from the API if you are using it in web or mobile integration. It's not ok to query the API on *every* page request you serve. The [demo](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/) shows how easy it can be to implement a file cache.

An extension to this API with access to all stations for partner applications is available. Contact us. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

Use SwaggerHub Registry API to access, manage, and update the following resources in SwaggerHub, bypassing the web interface:
  * APIs
  * Domains
  * Integrations
  * Projects
  * Templates


SwaggerHub also provides the [User Management API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/swagger-hub/user-management-api/) to get information about organizations and manage organization members.

# Base URL
Use the following base URL for SwaggerHub SaaS:
    
    http(s)://api.swaggerhub.com

**Note:** This documentation is for SwaggerHub SaaS. On-Premise customers should use the bundled API definition, which can be found at the URLs provided below.

Version 1.29.0 or later:

    http(s)://SERVER/v1/openapi.yaml - YAML version
    http(s)://SERVER/v1/openapi.json - JSON version

Earlier versions:

    http(s)://SERVER/v1/swagger.yaml - YAML version
    http(s)://SERVER/v1/swagger.json - JSON version

# Authentication
Operations that update data or access private data require authentication using an API key. You can find your personal API key on the [API Keys](https://app.swaggerhub.com/settings/apiKey) page in your account settings. Send this key in the `Authorization` header when making requests to the Registry API:

    Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY

To test API calls from this documentation page, click the **Authorize** button below and paste your API key there.

**Important:** Keep the API key secure and do not store it directly in your code.
# Tools
In addition to calling the Registry API directly, you can use the following tools to interact with the API from the command line or CI/CD pipeline:

 * [SwaggerHub CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swaggerhub-cli) 
 * [Maven plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swaggerhub-maven-plugin)

| [TheTVDB API v3](https://thetvdb.com) | API v3 targets v2 functionality with a few minor additions. The API is accessible via https://api.thetvdb.com and provides the following REST endpoints in JSON format.


How to use this API documentation
----------------


You may browse the API routes without authentication, but if you wish to send requests to the API and see response data, then you must authenticate.
1. Obtain a JWT token by `POST`ing  to the `/login` route in the `Authentication` section with your API key and credentials.
1. Paste the JWT token from the response into the "JWT Token" field at the top of the page and click the 'Add Token' button.


You will now be able to use the remaining routes to send requests to the API and get a response.


Language Selection
----------------


Language selection is done via the `Accept-Language` header. At the moment, you may only pass one language abbreviation in the header at a time. Valid language abbreviations can be found at the `/languages` route..


Authentication
----------------


Authentication to use the API is similar to the How-to section above. Users must `POST` to the `/login` route with their API key and credentials in the following format in order to obtain a JWT token.

`{"apikey":"APIKEY","username":"USERNAME","userkey":"USERKEY"}`

Note that the username and key are ONLY required for the `/user` routes. The user's key is labled `Account Identifier` in the account section of the main site.
The token is then used in all subsequent requests by providing it in the `Authorization` header. The header will look like: `Authorization: Bearer <yourJWTtoken>`. Currently, the token expires after 24 hours. You can `GET` the `/refresh_token` route to extend that expiration date.


Versioning
----------------


You may request a different version of the API by including an `Accept` header in your request with the following format: `Accept:application/vnd.thetvdb.v$VERSION`. This documentation automatically uses the version seen at the top and bottom of the page. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [VA Forms](https://va.gov) | Use the VA Forms API to search for VA forms, get the form's PDF link and metadata, and check for new versions.

Visit our VA Lighthouse [Contact Us page](https://developer.va.gov/support) for further assistance.

## Background
This API offers an efficient way to stay up-to-date with the latest VA forms and information. The forms information listed on VA.gov matches the information returned by this API.
- Search by form number, keyword, or title
- Get a link to the form in PDF format
- Get detailed form metadata including the number of pages, related forms, benefit categories, language, and more
- Retrieve the latest date of PDF changes and the SHA256 checksum
- Identify when a form is deleted by the VA

## Technical summary
The VA Forms API collects form data from the official VA Form Repository on a nightly basis.  The Index endpoint can return all available forms or, if an optional query parameter is passed, will return only forms that may relate to the query value. When a valid form name is passed to the Show endpoint, it will return a single form with additional metadata and full revision history. A JSON response is given with the PDF link (if published) and the corresponding form metadata.

### Authentication and authorization
The form information shared by this API is publicly available.  API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name apikey. [Get a sandbox API Key](https://developer.va.gov/apply).

### Testing in sandbox environment
Form data in the sandbox environment is for testing your API only, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. This API also has a reduced API rate limit. When you're ready to move to production, be sure to [request a production API key.](https://developer.va.gov/go-live)

### SHA256 revision history
Each form is checked nightly for recent file changes. A corresponding SHA256 checksum is calculated, which provides a record of when the PDF changed and the SHA256 hash that was calculated. This allows end users to know that they have the most recent version and can verify the integrity of a previously downloaded PDF.

### Valid PDF link
Additionally, during the nightly refresh process, the link to the form PDF is verified and the `valid_pdf` metadata is updated accordingly. If marked `true`, the link is valid and is a current form. If marked `false`, the link is either broken or the form has been removed.

### Deleted forms
If the `deleted_at` metadata is set, that means the VA has removed this form from the repository and it is no longer to be used. | `apiKey` | Yes | Unknown |

| [AWS Amazon Interactive Video Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) | <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors.</p> <p>The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS page</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <i> <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. </b> </i> </p> <p>For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html"> Document History</a>.</p> <p> <b>Allowed Header Values</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code> <b>Accept:</b> </code> application/json</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> </code> gzip, deflate</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <b>Content-Type:</b> </code>application/json</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html"> Getting Started with Amazon IVS</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Channel</b> — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information. <i> <b>Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b> </i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html"> Access Tags</a>). </p> <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p> <p> <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b> </p> <p>Note the differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization is needed to view <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Amazon IVS private channels</a>. (Private channels are channels that are enabled for "playback authorization.")</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Authentication</b> </p> <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the requested action.

| [Bigoven 1,000,000+ Recipe and Grocery List API (v2)](https://bigoven.com) | #Documentation

This is the documentation for the partner endpoint of the BigOven Recipe and Grocery List API.

The update brings with it Swagger-based documentation. [Swagger](http://swagger.io) is an emerging standard for describing REST-based APIs, and with this Swagger-compliant endpoint (above), you can make ready-to-go interface libraries for your code via [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). For instance, it's easy to generate libraries for Node.js, Java, Ruby, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, php and more!

You can also try out the endpoint calls with your own api_key right here on this page. Be sure to enter your api_key above to use the "Try it out!" buttons on this page.

##Start Here

Developers new to the BigOven API should start with this version, not with the legacy API. We'll be making improvements to this API over time, and doing only bug fixes on the v1 API.



To pretend you're a BigOven user (for instance, to get your recently viewed recipes or your grocery list), you need to pass in Basic Authentication information in the header, just as with the v1 API. We do now require that you make all calls via https. You need to pass your api_key in with every call, though this can now be done on the header (send a request header "X-BigOven-API-Key" set to your api_key value, e.g., Request["X-BigOven-API-Key"]="your-key-here".)

##Migration Notes

For existing partners, we encourage you to [migrate](https://api2.bigoven.com), and while at this writing we have no hard-and-fast termination date for the v1 API, we strongly prefer that you migrate by January 1, 2017. While the changes aren't overly complex, there are several breaking changes, including refactoring of recipe search and results and removal of support for XML. This is not a simply plug-and-play replacement to the v1 API. With respect to an exclusive focus on JSON, the world has spoken, and it prefers JSON for REST-based API's. We've taken numerous steps to refactor the API to make it more REST-compliant. Note that this v2 API will be the preferred API from this point onward, so we encourage developers to migrate to this new format. We have put together some [migration notes](/web/documentation/migration-to-v2) that we encourage you to read carefully.

| [Braze Endpoints](https://braze.com) | # Braze API Overview

Braze provides a high performance REST API to allow you to track users, send messages, export data, and more.

A REST API is a way to programmatically transfer information over the web using a predefined schema. Braze has created many different endpoints with specific requirements that will perform various actions and/or return various data. API access is done using HTTPS web requests to your company's REST API endpoint (this will correspond to your Dashboard URL as shown in the table below).

Customers using Braze's EU database should use `https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu/`. For more information on REST API endpoints for customers using Braze's EU database see our [EU/US Implementation Differences documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/eu01_us3_sdk_implementation_differences/overview/).

# Using Braze's Postman Collection 

If you have a Postman account (MacOS, Windows, and Linux versions can be downloaded from their website located [here](https://www.getpostman.com)), you can go to our Postman documentation and click the orange `Run in Postman` button in the top, right corner. This will allow you to [create an environment](#setting-up-your-postman-environment), as well as edit the available `POST` and `GET` requests to suit your own needs.

## Setting Up Your Postman Environment

The Braze Postman Collection uses a templating variable, `{{instance_url}}`, to substitute the REST API URL of your Braze instance into the pre-built requests. Rather than having to manually edit all requests in the Collection, you can set up this variable in your Postman environment. To do so, please follow the steps below:

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the Postman app. 
2. Select "Manage Environments" to open a modal window which displays your active environments.
3. In the bottom right corner of the modal window, click "Add" to create a new environment.
4. Give this environment a name (e.g. "Braze API Requests") and add keys for `instance_url` and `api_key` with values corresponding to [your Braze instance](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#endpoints) and [Braze REST API Key](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#app-group-rest-api-keys), as pictured below. 

As of April, 2020 Braze has changed how we read App Group API keys. Instead of passing them in the request body or through url parameters, we now read the App Group Rest`api_key` through the HTTP Authorization header. API keys not passed through the HTTP Authorization Header will coninue to work until they have been sunset. 

## Using the Pre-Built Requests from the Collection

Once you have configured your environment. You can use any of the pre-built requests in the collection as a template for building new API requests. To start using one of the pre-built requests, simply click on it within the 'Collections' menu on the left side of Postman. This will open the request as a new tab in the main window of the Postman app.

In general, there are two types of requests that Braze's API endpoints accept - `GET` and `POST`. Depending on which `HTTP` method the endpoint uses, you'll need to edit the pre-built request differently.

### Edit a POST Request

When editing a `POST` request, you'll need to open the request and navigate to the `Body` section in the request editor. For readability, select the `raw` radio button to format the `JSON` request body.

### Edit a GET Request

When editing a `GET` request, you will need to edit the parameters passed in the request URL. To edit these easily, select the `Params` button next to the URL bar and edit the key-value pairs in the fields that will appear below the URL bar.

## Send Your Request

Once your API request is ready to send, click on the 'Send' button next to the URL bar. The request will be sent and the response data will be populated in a section underneath the request editor. From here, you can view the raw data returned from Braze's API, see the HTTP response code, see how long the request took to process, and view header information. | No | Yes | Unknown |

# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to build or set up Envoice Apps which subscribe to invoice activities. 
When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. 
Webhooks can be used to update an external invoice data storage.

In order to use webhooks visit [this link](/account/settings#api-tab) and add upto 10 webhook urls that will return status `200` in order to signal that the webhook is working.
All nonworking webhooks will be ignored after a certain period of time and several retry attempts.
If after several attempts the webhook starts to work, we will send you all activities, both past and present, in chronological order.

The payload of the webhook is in format:
```
{
    Signature: ""sha256 string"",
    Timestamp: ""YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.FFFFFFFZ"",

| [PandaScore REST API for All Videogames](https://pandascore.co) | # Introduction

Whether you're looking to build an official Pandascore integration for your service, or you just want to build something awesome, [we can help you get started](/home).

The API works over the HTTPS protocol, and is accessed from the `api.pandascore.co` domain.

- The current endpoint is [https://api.pandascore.co](https://api.pandascore.co).
- All data is sent and received as JSON by default.
- Blank fields are included with `null` values instead of being omitted.
- All timestamps are returned in ISO-8601 format

### About this documentation

Clicking on a query parameter like `filter` or `search` will show you the available options: ![filter](/doc/images/query_param_details.jpg)

You can also click on a response to see the detailed response schema: ![response](/doc/images/response_schema.jpg)

## Events hierarchy

The PandaScore API allows you to access data about eSports events by using a certain structure detailed below.

**Leagues**

Leagues are the top level events. They don't have a date and represent a regular competition. A League is composed of one or several series.  
Some League of Legends leagues are: _EU LCS, NA LCS, LCK, etc._  
Some Dota 2 leagues are: _ESL One, GESC, The International, PGL, etc._

**Series**

A Serie represents an occurrence of a league event.  
The EU LCS league has two series per year: _spring 2017, summer 2017, spring 2016, summer 2016 etc._  
Some Dota2 Series examples would be: _Changsha Major, Open Bucharest, Frankfurt, i-League Invitational etc._

**Tournaments**

Tournaments groups all the matches of a serie under "stages" and "groups".  
The tournaments of the EU LCS of summer 2017 are: _Group A, Group B, Playoffs, etc._  
Some Dota 2 tournaments are: _Group A, Group B, Playoffs, etc._

**Matches**

Finally we have matches which have two players or teams (depending on the played videogame) and several games (the rounds of the match).  
Matches of the group A in the EU LCS of summer 2017 are: _G2 vs FNC, MSF vs NIP, etc._  
Matches of the group A in the ESL One, Genting tournamnet are: _Lower Round 1, Quarterfinal, Upper Final, etc._  

**Please note that some matches may be listed as "TBD vs TBD" if the matchup is not announced yet, for example the date of the Final match is known but the quarterfinal is still being played.**  
![Structure](/doc/images/structure.png)

## Formats

&lt;!-- The API currently supports the JSON format by default, as well as the XML format. Add the desired extension to your request URL in order to get that format. --&gt;
The API currently supports the JSON format by default.

Other formats may be added depending on user needs.

## Pagination

The Pandascore API paginates all resources on the index method.

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 50 items by default. You can specify further pages with the `page[number]` parameter. You can also set a custom page size (up to 100) with the `page[size]` parameter.

The `Link` HTTP response header contains pagination data with `first`, `previous`, `next` and `last` raw page links when available, under the format

```
Link: &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=X+1&gt;; rel="next", &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=X-1&gt;; rel="prev", &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=1&gt;; rel="first", &lt;https://api.pandascore.co/{Resource}?page=X+n&gt;; rel="last"
```

There is also:

* A `X-Page` header field, which contains the current page.
* A `X-Per-Page` header field, which contains the current pagination length.
* A `X-Total` header field, which contains the total count of items across all pages.

## Filtering

The `filter` query parameter can be used to filter a collection by one or several fields for one or several values. The `filter` parameter takes the field to filter as a key, and the values to filter as the value. Multiples values must be comma-separated (`,`).

For example, the following is a request for all the champions with a name matching Twitch or Brand exactly, but only with 21 armor:

```
GET /lol/champions?filter[name]=Brand,Twitch&amp;filter[armor]=21&amp;token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Range

The `range` parameter is a hash that allows filtering fields by an interval.
Only values between the given two comma-separated bounds will be returned. The bounds are inclusive.

For example, the following is a request for all the champions with `hp` within 500 and 1000:

```
GET /lol/champions?range[hp]=500,1000&amp;token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Search

The `search` parameter is a bit like the `filter` parameter, but it will return all results where the values **contain** the given parameter.

Note: this only works on strings.
Searching with integer values is not supported and `filter` or `range` parameters may be better suited for your needs here.

For example, to get all the champions with a name containing `"twi"`:

```
$ curl -sg -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' 'https://api.pandascore.co/lol/champions?search[name]=twi' \| jq -S '.[].name'
"Twitch"
"Twisted Fate"
```

## Sorting

All index endpoints support multiple sort fields with comma-separation (`,`); the fields are applied in the order specified.

The sort order for each field is ascending unless it is prefixed with a minus (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“), in which case it is descending.

For example, `GET /lol/champions?sort=attackdamage,-name&amp;token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` will return all the champions sorted by attack damage.
Any champions with the same attack damage will then be sorted by their names in descending alphabetical order.

## Rate limiting

Depending on your current plan, you will have a different rate limit. Your plan and your current request count [are available on your dashboard](https://pandascore.co/settings).

With the **free plan**, you have a limit of 1000 requests per hour, others plans have a limit of 4000 requests per hour. The number of remaining requests is available in the `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` response header.

Your API key is included in all the examples on this page, so you can test any example right away. **Only you can see this value.**

# Authentication

The authentication on the Pandascore API works with access tokens.

All developers need to [create an account](https://pandascore.co/users/sign_in) before getting started, in order to get an access token. The access token should not be shared.

**Your token can be found and regenerated from [your dashboard](https://pandascore.co/settings).**

The access token can be passed in the URL with the `token` query string parameter, or in the `Authorization: Bearer` header field.

&lt;!-- ReDoc-Inject: &lt;security-definitions&gt; --&gt; | `Bearer` | Yes | Unknown |
| [Prss ContentDepot](https://prss.org) | ContentDepot hosts a range of API’s that allow clients to manage, discover, and obtain content. The API spans many parts of the ContentDepot functionality including MetaPub (a.k.a. metadata distribution) and content management.

## MetaPub

MetaPub collects, normalizes and distributes publicly available program, episode, and piece metadata through the public radio system. Backed by ContentDepot and its data model, MetaPub allows producers to supply metadata through various methods:

1. MetaPub Agents that collect producer metadata by "crawling" existing public feeds (e.g. C24, BBC) or the producer's production system (e.g. ATC, ME, TED Radio Hour).
2. Manually enter metadata in the ContentDepot Portal on each program and episode.
3. Publish/push the metadata to the MetaPub upload API and execute an ingest job.

MetaPub then distributes this data to stations through an electronic program guide (EPG model) for display on various listener devices such as smart phones, tablets, web streams, HD radios, RDBS enabled FM radios, and more. The EPG format is based on the RadioDNS specifications.

### RadioDNS

The RadioDNS Service and Programme Information Specification ([ETSI TS 102 818 v3.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102800_102899/102818/03.04.01_60/ts_102818v030401p.pdf)) defines three primary documents: Service Information, Program Information, and Group Information. These documents, along with the core RadioDNS Hybrid Lookup for Radio Services Specification ([ETSI TS 103 270 v1.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103270/01.04.01_60/ts_103270v010401p.pdf)), define a system where an end listener device can dynamically discover program metadata and fetch the metadata via Internet Protocol (IP) requests. MetaPub's use of RadioDNS differs slightly in that MetaPub (a.k.a PRSS) acts as the "service provider" while the stations and related middleware act as the end devices. While this is not the primary use case of RadioDNS, the flexibility in the specification, service definitions, and DNS resolution allows this model to be easily represented. MetaPub provides both _National Metadata_ and _Station Metadata_.

It is strongly recommended that the related [RadioDNS specifications](https://radiodns.org/developers/documentation/) be read for implementation details, definitions, and required XML schemas.

## ContentDepot Drive

ContentDepot Drive (CD Drive) provides a private, per customer file storage solution similar to other cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. The CD Drive is used to stage content uploads such as metadata files, images, or segment audio before associating the content with specific programs or episodes.

CD Drive content can be referenced using a URI by some operations such as synchronizing metadata. There are two possible CD Drive URI formats supported: ID and hierarchical path. The ID reference takes the form ```cddrive:id:{value}``` where value is the integer ID of the file or folder being referenced. The hierarchical path reference takes the form ```cddrive://{path}``` where path is the full, UNIX style path to the file or folder starting with '/'. For example, two CD Drive URIs pointing to the same file may be ```cddrive:id:12345``` and ```cddrive:///show1/episode2/metadata.xml```. More information about URIs can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

## Authentication

The API currently uses OAuth 2.0.  All operations require ```cd:full``` access where the client access is only limited by the permissions of the ContentDepot user after authentication. Limiting access scope per client is not currently supported. | `OAuth` | Yes | Unknown |

| [SimplyRETS](https://simplyrets.com) | The SimplyRETS API is an exciting step towards making it easier for
developers and real estate agents to build something awesome with
real estate data!

The documentation below makes live requests to our API using the
trial data. To get set up with the API using live MLS data, you
must have RETS credentials from your MLS, which you can then use to
create an app with SimplyRETS. For more information on that
process, please see our [FAQ](https://simplyrets.com/faq), [Getting
Started](https://simplyrets.com/blog/getting-set-up.html) page, or
[contact us](https://simplyrets.com/\#home-contact).

Below you'll find the API endpoints, query parameters, response bodies,
and other information about using the SimplyRETS API. You can run
queries by clicking the 'Try it Out' button at the bottom of each
section.

### Authentication
The SimplyRETS API uses Basic Authentication. When you create an
app, you'll get a set of API credentials to access your
listings. If you're trying out the test data, you can use
`simplyrets:simplyrets` for connecting to the API.

### Media Types
The SimplyRETS API uses the `Accept` header to allow clients to
control media types (content versions). We maintain backwards
compatibility with API clients by allowing them to specify a
content version. We highly recommend setting and explicity media
type when your application reaches production. Both the structure
and content of our API response bodies is subject to change so we
can add new features while respecting the stability of applications
which have already been developed.

To always use the latest SimplyRETS content version, simply use
`application/json` in your application `Accept` header.

If you want to pin your clients media type to a specific version,
you can use the vendor-specific SimplyRETS media type, e.g.
`application/vnd.simplyrets-v0.1+json"`

To view all valid content-types for making an `OPTIONS`, make a
request to the SimplyRETS api root

`curl -XOPTIONS -u simplyrets:simplyrets https://api.simplyrets.com/`

The default media types used in our API responses may change in the
future. If you're building an application and care about the
stability of the API, be sure to request a specific media type in the
Accept header as shown in the examples below.

The wordpress plugin automatically sets the `Accept` header for the
compatible SimplyRETS media types.

### Pagination

To paginate through listings, start your query with these
parameters: 'limit=500&lastId=0'. The 'lastId' is the important
part, you can use any limit up to 500. When you receive the
response from the API with the results, check the 'Link' header for
the 'next' link. That link is pre-built to access the next 'page'
of listings. Alternatively, you can use the last listing's 'mlsId'
from the previous request and use that in the next query. For
example:

First query:

curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=0'

If the 'mlsId' in the last listing of the results is '1234567', then the next query will be:

curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=1234567'

...and so one until you have reached the final page of listings.

There a few pieces of useful information about each request stored
in the HTTP Headers:

- `X-Total-Count` shows you the total amount of listings that match
  your current query.
- `Link` contains pre-built pagination links for accessing the next
'page' of listings that match your query.

### RETS Vendor Compliance

Many RETS vendors have strict requirements for showing disclaimers
with specific information embedded. For example, in many areas it's
required to show the timestamp of the time the listings were
refreshed inside a disclaimer or on a listing page.

The timestamp of the last listing refresh timestamp can be found in
one of two spots:

- The `X-SimplyRETS-LastUpdate` header from `GET /properties` or `GET /properties/{mlsId}`

- Calling the API root `/` or properties api endpoint `/properties`
  with an OPTIONS request

  - `OPTIONS /`

    This request will show the last update timestamp for all RETS
    vendors associated with your application. Look for the
    `updates` list in the JSON response.

  - `OPTIONS /properties`

    Using this request, look for the `lastUpdate` field in the JSON
    response. | `Basic` | Yes | Unknown |

| [VisibleThread API](https://visiblethread.com) | ## Introduction
The VisibleThread b API provides services for analyzing/searching documents and web pages.
To use the service you need an API key. 

**Contact us at support@visiblethread.com to request an API key**. 

The services are split into **Documents** and **Webscans**.

### Documents
Upload documents and dictionaries so you can :
- Measure the readability of your document
- search a document for all terms from a dictionary
- retrieve all paragraphs from a document or only matching paragraphs

### Webscans
Analyze web pages so you can: 
- Measure the readability of your web content
- Identify & highlight content issues e.g. long sentences, passive voice

The VisibleThread API allows you to programatially submit webpage urls to be scanned, 
check on the results of a scan, and view a list of previous scans you have performed.
    
-------------

The VisibleThread API is a HTTP-based JSON API, accessible at https://api.visiblethread.com 
Each request to the service requires your API key to be successful.

## Getting Started With Webscans

Steps:
1. Enter your API key above and hit **Explore**. 
2. Run a new scan by submitting a **POST to /webscans** (title and some webUrls are required).
   The scan runs asynchronously in the background but returns immediately with a JSON response containing an "id" that represents your scan.
3. Check on the status of a scan by submitting **GET /webscans/{scanId}**, if the scan is still in progress it will return a HTTP 503. If 
   it is complete it will return a HTTP 200 with the appropriate JSON outlining the urls scanned and the summary statistics for each url.
4. Retrieve all your previous scan results by submitting **GET /webscans**.  
5. Retrieve detailed results for a url within a scan (readability, long sentence and passive language instances) by submitting 
   **GET /webscans/{scanId}/webUrls/{urlId}** (scanId and urlId are required)

1. Upload a csv file to use as a keyword dictionary by submitting a **POST to /dictionaries** (csv file required). This returns a JSON 
   response with the dictionary Id 
2. Search a document with the dictionary by submitting a **POST to /searches** (document id and dictionary id required). 
3. Get the resuhlts of the search by submitting  **GET /searches/{docId}/{dictionaryId}" . This will return JSON response containing 
   detailed results of searching the document using the dictionary.
4. To view the list of all searches you have performed submit a **GET /searches**.

| [Ornl Daymet Single Pixel Extraction Tool API](https://ornl.gov) | Welcome to the Daymet Single Pixel Extraction Tool API. You can use this API to download daily surface data within the Daymet database in a `csv` or `json` format for a single point. This API allows users to query a single geographic point by latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. A routine is executed that translates the (lon, lat) coordinates into projected Daymet (x,y) Lambert Conformal Coordinates. These coordinates are used to access the Daymet database of daily interpolated surface weather variables. Daily data from the nearest 1 km x 1 km Daymet grid cell are extracted from the database.
